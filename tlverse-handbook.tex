\section*{What this book is not}\label{what-this-book-is-not}}


This book does \textbf{not} focus on providing in-depth technically sophisticated
descriptions of modern statistical methodology or recent advancements in
Targeted Learning. Instead, the goal is to convey key details of these
state-of-the-art statistical techniques in a manner that is clear, complete, and
intuitive, while simultaneously avoiding the cognitive burden carried by
extraneous details (e.g., mathematically niche theoretical arguments). Our aim
is for the presentations herein to serve as a coherent reference for researchers
-- applied methodologists and domain specialists alike -- that empower them to
deploy the central statistical tools of Targeted Learning in a manner efficient
for their scientific pursuits. For a mathematically sophisticated treatment of
some of these topics, inclusive of in-depth technical details, in the field of
Targeted Learning, the interested reader is invited to consult \citet{vdl2011targeted}
and \citet{vdl2018targeted}, among numerous other works, as appropriate. The primary
literature in causal inference, machine learning, and non/semi-parametric
statistical theory include many of the most recent advances in Targeted Learning
and related areas. For background in causal inference, \citet{hernan2022causal} serves
as an introductory modern reference.

statistician to begin understanding and applying these methods. However, it is
highly recommended for the reader to have an understanding of basic statistical
concepts such as confounding, probability distributions, confidence intervals,
hypothesis tests, and regression. Advanced knowledge of mathematical statistics
may be useful but is not necessary. Familiarity with the \passthrough{\lstinline!R!} programming
language will be essential. We also recommend an understanding of introductory
causal inference.

\begin{quote}
``One enemy of robust science is our humanity -- our appetite for
being right, and our tendency to find patterns in noise, to see supporting
evidence for what we already believe is true, and to ignore the facts that do
not fit.''

--- \citet{naturenews_2015}
\end{quote}

Scientific research is at a unique point in its history. The need to improve
rigor and reproducibility is greater than ever. Corroboration moves science
forward, yet there is growing alarm that results cannot be reproduced or
validated, suggesting that many discoveries may be false or less robust than
initially claimed \citep{baker2016there}. A failure to meet this need will result in
further declines in the rate of scientific progress, tarnishing of the
reputation of the scientific enterprise as a whole, and erosion of the public's
trust in scientific findings \citep{munafo2017manifesto, naturenews2_2015}.

\begin{quote}
``The key question we want to answer when seeing the results of any scientific
study is whether we can trust the data analysis.''

--- \citet{peng2015reproducibility}
\end{quote}

Unfortunately, in its current state, the culture of statistical data analysis
enables, rather than precludes, the manner in which human bias may affect the
results of (ideally objective) data analytic efforts. A significant degree of
human bias enters into statistical data analysis efforts in the form of improper
model selection. All procedures for estimation and hypothesis testing are
derived based on a choice of a statistical model; thus, obtaining valid
estimates and statistical inference relies critically on the chosen model
containing an accurate representation of the process that generated the data.

Consider, for example, a hypothetical study in which a treatment is assigned to
a group of patients -- was the treatment assigned randomly, or were
characteristics of the individuals (i.e., ``baseline covariates'') taken into
account in making the treatment assignment decision? What's more, in light of
patient characteristics and heterogeneity in clinician decision-making, are
patients assigned to the treatment arm uniformly receiving the same treatment?
Any such knowledge can -- indeed, \emph{must} -- be incorporated into the choice of
statistical model. Alternatively, the data could arise from an observational
study (or ``quasi-experiment''), in which there is no (or very limited) control
over the treatment assignment mechanism. In such cases, available knowledge
about the data-generating process (DGP) is even more limited. In these
situations, the statistical model should contain \emph{all} possible distributions of
the data. In practice, however, models are not selected based on scientific
knowledge available about the DGP; instead, models are often selected based on
(1) the philosophical leanings of the analyst, (2) the relative convenience of
implementation of statistical methods admissible within the choice of model, and
(3) the results of significance testing (i.e., p-values).

This practice of ``cargo-cult statistics --- the ritualistic miming of statistics
rather than conscientious practice,'' \citep{stark2018cargo} is characterized by
arbitrary modeling choices, even when these choices often result in different
answers to the same research question. As opposed to its original purpose of
safeguarding the scientific process -- by providing formal techniques for
evaluating the veracity of a claim using properly designed experiments and data
collection procedures -- Statistics is increasingly often used ``to aid and abet
weak science, a role it can perform well when used mechanically or
ritual{[}istically{]}'' \citep{stark2018cargo}. The current trend in deriving scientific
discoveries by way of abusing statistical methods helps to explain the modern
epidemic of false findings from which scientific research is suffering
\citep{vdl2014entering}.

\begin{quote}
``We suggest that the weak statistical understanding is probably due to
inadequate''statistics lite'' education. This approach does not build up
appropriate mathematical fundamentals and does not provide scientifically
rigorous introduction into statistics. Hence, students' knowledge may remain
imprecise, patchy, and prone to serious misunderstandings. What this approach
achieves, however, is providing students with false confidence of being able
to use inferential tools whereas they usually only interpret the p-value
provided by black box statistical software. While this educational problem
remains unaddressed, poor statistical practices will prevail regardless of
what procedures and measures may be favored and/or banned by editorials.''

--- \citet{szucs2017null}
\end{quote}

Our team at the University of California, Berkeley is uniquely positioned to
provide such an education. Spearheaded by Professor Mark van der Laan, and
now spreading rapidly through his students and colleagues who have greatly
enriched the field, the aptly named ``Targeted Learning'' paradigm emphasizes a
focus upon (i.e., ``targeting of'') the scientific question motivating a given
study or dataset. The philosophy of Targeted Learning runs counter to the
current cultural problem of ``convenience statistics,'' which opens the door to
biased estimation, misleading data analytic results, and erroneous discoveries.
Targeted Learning (TL) embraces the fundamentals that formalized the field of
Statistics, notably including the dual notions that a statistical model must
represent real knowledge about the data-generating experiment and that a target
parameter (a particular feature of the data-generating probability distribution)
represents what we seek to learn from the data \citep{vdl2014entering}. In this way,
TL defines a ground truth and establishes a principled standard for inference,
thereby curtailing opportunities for our all-too-human biases (e.g., hindsight
bias, confirmation bias, and outcome bias) to infiltrate our efforts at
objective data analysis.

\begin{quote}
``The key for effective classical {[}statistical{]} inference is to have
well-defined questions and an analysis plan that tests those questions.''

--- \citet{nosek2018preregistration}
\end{quote}

Inspired loosely by R.A. Fisher's influential classic \emph{Statistical Methods for
Research Workers} \citep{fisher1946statistical}, this handbook aims to provide
practical training for students, researchers, industry professionals, and
academicians in the sciences (broadly considered -- whether biological,
physical, economic, or social), medicine and public health, statistics, and
numerous other allied disciplines, equipping them with the necessary knowledge
and skills to utilize the methodological developments of TL. The Targeted
Learning paradigm encompasses a principled set of techniques, united by a single
philosophy, for developing answers to queries with confidence, utilizing
advances in causal inference, state-of-the-art non/semi-parametric statistical
theory, and machine learning --- so that each and every data analysis is
realistic, reflecting appropriately what is known (and unknown) about the
process that generated the data,
while remaining fully compatible with the guiding principles of computational
reproducibility.

Just as the conscientious use of modern statistical methodology is necessary to
ensure that scientific practice thrives --- robust, well-tested software plays a
critical role in allowing practitioners to access the published results of a
given scientific investigation. We concur with the view put forth by
\citet{buckheit1995wavelab} that ``an article\ldots in a scientific publication is not the
scholarship itself, it is merely advertising of the scholarship. The actual
scholarship is the complete software development environment and the complete
set of instructions which generated the figures,'' making the availability and
adoption of robust statistical software key to enhancing the transparency that
is an inherent (and assumed) aspect of the scientific process.

For a statistical methodology to be readily accessible in practice, it is
crucial that it is accompanied by user-friendly software
\citep{pullenayegum2016knowledge, stromberg2004write}. The \passthrough{\lstinline!tlverse!} software
ecosystem, composed of a set of packages for the \passthrough{\lstinline!R!} language and environment for
statistical computing \citep{R}, was developed to fulfill this need for the TL
methodological framework. Not only does this suite of software tools
facilitate computationally reproducible and efficient analyses, it is also a
tool for TL education. Rather than focusing on implementing a specific estimator
or a small set of related estimators, the design paradigm of the \passthrough{\lstinline!tlverse!}
ecosystem focuses on exposing the statistical framework of Targeted Learning
itself: all software packages in the \passthrough{\lstinline!tlverse!} ecosystem directly model the key
objects defined in the mathematical and theoretical framework of Targeted
Learning. What's more, the \passthrough{\lstinline!tlverse!} software packages share a core set of
design principles centered on extensibility, allowing for them to be used in
conjunction with each other and used cohesively as building blocks for
formulating sophisticated statistical analyses. For an introduction to the TL
framework, we recommend \citet{coyle2021targeted}'s \href{https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.07333}{recent review
paper}.

In this handbook, the reader will embark on a journey through the \passthrough{\lstinline!tlverse!}
ecosystem. Guided by \passthrough{\lstinline!R!} programming exercises, case studies, and
intuition-building explanations, readers will learn to use this toolbox for
applying the TL statistical methodology, which will translate to real-world
causal analyses. Some preliminaries are required prior to this learning endeavor
-- for this, we provide a list of \protect\hyperlink{learn}{recommended learning resources}.

loss-based) estimators (i.e., TMLEs). The construction of any Targeted Learning
estimator proceeds through a two-stage process:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Flexibly learning particular components of the data-generating distribution
  often through machine learning (e.g., Super Learning), resulting in \emph{initial
  estimates} of nuisance parameters.
\item
  Use of a carefully constructed parametric model-based update, via maximum
  likelihood estimation (i.e., MLE), incorporating the initial estimates
  produced by the prior step to produce a TML estimator.
\end{enumerate}

The packages making up the core components of the \passthrough{\lstinline!tlverse!} software ecosystem
-- \passthrough{\lstinline!sl3!} and \passthrough{\lstinline!tmle3!} -- address the above two goals, respectively. Together, the
general functionality exposed by both allows one to build specific TMLEs
tailored exactly to a particular statistical estimation problem.

The software packages that make up the \textbf{core} of the \passthrough{\lstinline!tlverse!} are

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \href{https://github.com/tlverse/sl3}{\passthrough{\lstinline!sl3!}}: Modern Super Machine Learning

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \emph{What?} A modern object-oriented implementation of the Super Learner
    algorithm, employing recently developed paradigms in \passthrough{\lstinline!R!} programming.
  \item
    \emph{Why?} A design that leverages modern ideas for faster computation, is
    easily extensible and forward-looking, and forms one of the cornerstones of
    the \passthrough{\lstinline!tlverse!}.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \href{https://github.com/tlverse/tmle3}{\passthrough{\lstinline!tmle3!}}: An Engine for Targeted Learning

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \emph{What?} A generalized framework that simplifies Targeted Learning by
    identifying and implementing a series of common statistical estimation
    procedures.
  \item
    \emph{Why?} A common interface and engine that accommodates current algorithmic
    approaches to Targeted Learning and yet remains a flexible enough engine to
    power the implementation of emerging statistical techniques as they are
    developed.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Beyond these engines that provide the driving force behind the \passthrough{\lstinline!tlverse!}, there
are a few supporting packages that play important roles in the \textbf{background}:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \href{https://github.com/tlverse/origami}{\passthrough{\lstinline!origami!}}: A Generalized Framework for
  Cross-Validation \citep{coyle2018origami}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \emph{What?} A generalized framework for flexible cross-validation.
  \item
    \emph{Why?} Cross-validation is a key part of ensuring error estimates are honest
    and in preventing overfitting. It is an essential part of both the Super
    Learner ensemble modeling algorithm and in the construction of TML
    estimators.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \href{https://github.com/tlverse/delayed}{\passthrough{\lstinline!delayed!}}: Parallelization Framework for
  Dependent Tasks

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \emph{What?} A framework for delayed computations (i.e., futures) based on task
    dependencies.
  \item
    \emph{Why?} Efficient allocation of compute resources is essential when deploying
    computationally intensive algorithms at large scale.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

A key principle of the \passthrough{\lstinline!tlverse!} is extensibility. That is, the software
ecosystem aims to support the development of novel Targeted Learning estimators
as they reach maturity. To achieve this degree of flexibility, we follow the
model of implementing new classes of estimators, for distinct causal inference
problems in separate packages, all of which rely upon the core machinery
provided by \passthrough{\lstinline!sl3!} and \passthrough{\lstinline!tmle3!}. There are currently three examples:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \href{https://github.com/tlverse/tmle3mopttx}{\passthrough{\lstinline!tmle3mopttx!}}: Optimal Treatments
  in the \passthrough{\lstinline!tlverse!}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \emph{What?} Learn an optimal rule and estimate the mean outcome under the rule.
  \item
    \emph{Why?} Optimal treatments are a powerful tool in precision healthcare and
    other settings where a one-size-fits-all treatment approach is not
    appropriate.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \href{https://github.com/tlverse/tmle3shift}{\passthrough{\lstinline!tmle3shift!}}: Stochastic Shift
  Interventions based on Modified Treatment Policies in the \passthrough{\lstinline!tlverse!}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \emph{What?} Stochastic shift interventions for evaluating changes in
    continuous-valued treatments.
  \item
    \emph{Why?} Not all treatment variables are binary or categorical. Estimating the
    total effects of intervening on continuous-valued treatments provides a way
    to probe how an effect changes with shifts in the treatment variable.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \href{https://github.com/tlverse/tmle3mediate}{\passthrough{\lstinline!tmle3mediate!}}: Causal Mediation
  Analysis in the \passthrough{\lstinline!tlverse!}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \emph{What?} Techniques for evaluating the direct and indirect effects of
    treatments through mediating variables.
  \item
    \emph{Why?} Evaluating the total effect of a treatment does not provide
    information about the pathways through which it may operate. When mediating
    variables have been collected, one can instead evaluate direct and indirect
    effect parameters that speak to the \emph{action mechanism} of the treatment.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{\texorpdfstring{Primer on the \texttt{R6} Class System}{Primer on the R6 Class System}}\label{primer-on-the-r6-class-system}}

The \passthrough{\lstinline!tlverse!} is designed using basic object oriented programming (OOP)
principles and the \href{https://adv-r.hadley.nz/r6.html}{\passthrough{\lstinline!R6!} OOP framework}. While
we've tried to make it easy to use the \passthrough{\lstinline!tlverse!} packages without worrying much
about OOP, it is helpful to have some intuition about how the \passthrough{\lstinline!tlverse!} is
structured. Here, we briefly outline some key concepts from OOP. Readers
familiar with OOP basics are invited to skip this section.

\hypertarget{classes-fields-and-methods}{%
\subsection{Classes, Fields, and Methods}\label{classes-fields-and-methods}}

The key concept of OOP is that of an object, a collection of data and functions
that corresponds to some conceptual unit. Objects have two main types of
elements:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \emph{fields}, which can be thought of as nouns, are information about an object,
  and
\item
  \emph{methods}, which can be thought of as verbs, are actions an object can
  perform.
\end{enumerate}

Objects are members of classes, which define what those specific fields and
methods are. Classes can inherit elements from other classes (sometimes called
base classes) -- accordingly, classes that are similar, but not exactly the
same, can share some parts of their definitions.

Many different implementations of OOP exist, with variations in how these
concepts are implemented and used. \passthrough{\lstinline!R!} has several different implementations,
including \passthrough{\lstinline!S3!}, \passthrough{\lstinline!S4!}, reference classes, and \passthrough{\lstinline!R6!}. The \passthrough{\lstinline!tlverse!} uses the \passthrough{\lstinline!R6!}
implementation. In \passthrough{\lstinline!R6!}, methods and fields of a class object are accessed using
the \passthrough{\lstinline!$!} operator. For a more thorough introduction to \passthrough{\lstinline!R!}'s various OOP systems,
see \url{http://adv-r.had.co.nz/OO-essentials.html}, from Hadley Wickham's \emph{Advanced
R} \citep{wickham2014advanced}.

\hypertarget{object-oriented-programming-python-and-r}{%
\subsection*{\texorpdfstring{Object Oriented Programming: \texttt{Python} and \texttt{R}}{Object Oriented Programming: Python and R}}\label{object-oriented-programming-python-and-r}}


OO concepts (classes with inheritance) were baked into Python from the first
published version (version 0.9 in 1991). In contrast, \passthrough{\lstinline!R!} gets its OO ``approach''
from its predecessor, \passthrough{\lstinline!S!}, first released in 1976. For the first 15 years, \passthrough{\lstinline!S!}
had no support for classes, then, suddenly, \passthrough{\lstinline!S!} got two OO frameworks bolted on
in rapid succession: informal classes with \passthrough{\lstinline!S3!} in 1991, and formal classes with
\passthrough{\lstinline!S4!} in 1998. This process continues, with new OO frameworks being periodically
released, to try to improve the lackluster OO support in \passthrough{\lstinline!R!}, with reference
classes (\passthrough{\lstinline!R5!}, 2010) and \passthrough{\lstinline!R6!} (2014). Of these, \passthrough{\lstinline!R6!} behaves most like Python
classes (and also most like OOP focused languages like C++ and Java), including
having method definitions be part of class definitions, and allowing objects to
be modified by reference.

\hypertarget{installtlverse}{%
\section{\texorpdfstring{Install \texttt{tlverse}}{Install tlverse}}\label{installtlverse}}

The \passthrough{\lstinline!tlverse!} ecosystem of packages are currently hosted at
\url{https://github.com/tlverse}, not yet on \href{https://CRAN.R-project.org/}{CRAN}. You
can use the \href{https://usethis.r-lib.org/}{\passthrough{\lstinline!usethis!} package} to install them:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=R]
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("tlverse/tlverse")
\end{lstlisting}

The \passthrough{\lstinline!tlverse!} depends on a large number of other packages that are also hosted
on GitHub. Because of this, you may see the following error:

\begin{lstlisting}
Error: HTTP error 403.
  API rate limit exceeded for 71.204.135.82. (But here's the good news:
  Authenticated requests get a higher rate limit. Check out the documentation
  for more details.)

  Rate limit remaining: 0/60
  Rate limit reset at: 2019-03-04 19:39:05 UTC

  To increase your GitHub API rate limit
  - Use `usethis::browse_github_pat()` to create a Personal Access Token.
  - Use `usethis::edit_r_environ()` and add the token as `GITHUB_PAT`.
\end{lstlisting}

This just means that \passthrough{\lstinline!R!} tried to install too many packages from GitHub in too
short of a window. To fix this, you need to tell \passthrough{\lstinline!R!} how to use GitHub as your
user (you'll need a GitHub user account). Follow these two steps:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Type \passthrough{\lstinline!usethis::browse\_github\_pat()!} in your \passthrough{\lstinline!R!} console, which will direct
  you to GitHub's page to create a New Personal Access Token (PAT).
\item
  Create a PAT simply by clicking ``Generate token'' at the bottom of the page.
\item
  Copy your PAT, a long string of lowercase letters and numbers.
\item
  Type \passthrough{\lstinline!usethis::edit\_r\_environ()!} in your \passthrough{\lstinline!R!} console, which will open your
  \passthrough{\lstinline!.Renviron!} file in the source window of RStudio.

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\alph{enumii}.}
  \tightlist
  \item
    If your \passthrough{\lstinline!.Renviron!} file does not pop-up after calling
    \passthrough{\lstinline!usethis::edit\_r\_environ()!}; then try inputting
    \passthrough{\lstinline!Sys.setenv(GITHUB\_PAT = "yourPAT")!}, replacing your PAT with inside the
    quotes. If this does not error, then skip to step 8.
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  In your \passthrough{\lstinline!.Renviron!} file, type \passthrough{\lstinline!GITHUB\_PAT=!} and then paste your PAT after
  the equals symbol with no space.
\item
  In your \passthrough{\lstinline!.Renviron!} file, press the enter key to ensure that your \passthrough{\lstinline!.Renviron!}
  ends with a new line.
\item
  Save your \passthrough{\lstinline!.Renviron!} file. The example below shows how this syntax should
  look.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=R]
GITHUB_PAT=yourPAT
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{7}
\tightlist
\item
  Restart R. You can restart \passthrough{\lstinline!R!} via the drop-down menu on RStudio's ``Session''
  tab, which is located at the top of the RStudio interface. You have to
  restart \passthrough{\lstinline!R!} for the changes to take effect!
\end{enumerate}

After following these steps, you should be able to successfully install the
package which threw the error above.

\section{WASH Benefits Bangladesh Study}\label{wash}}

The example data come from a study of the effect of water quality, sanitation,
hand washing, and nutritional interventions on child development in rural
Bangladesh (WASH Benefits Bangladesh), a cluster randomized controlled trial
\citep{luby2018effect}. The study enrolled pregnant women in their first or second
trimester from the rural villages of Gazipur, Kishoreganj, Mymensingh, and
Tangail districts of central Bangladesh, with an average of eight women per
cluster. Groups of eight geographically adjacent clusters were block randomized,
using a random number generator, into six intervention groups (all of which
received weekly visits from a community health promoter for the first 6 months
and every 2 weeks for the next 18 months) and a double-sized control group (no
intervention or health promoter visit). The six intervention groups were:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  chlorinated drinking water;
\item
  improved sanitation;
\item
  handwashing with soap;
\item
  combined water, sanitation, and handwashing;
\item
  improved nutrition through counseling and provision of lipid-based nutrient
  supplements; and
\item
  combined water, sanitation, handwashing, and nutrition.
\end{enumerate}

In the handbook, we concentrate on child growth (size for age) as the outcome of
interest. For reference, this trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov under
registration number NCT01590095.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=R]
library(readr)
# read in data via readr::read_csv
dat <- read_csv(
  paste0(
    "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tlverse/tlverse-data/master/",
    "wash-benefits/washb_data.csv"
  )
)
\end{lstlisting}

For instructional purposes, we start by treating the data as independent and
identically distributed (i.i.d.) random draws from a large target population. We
could account for the clustering of the data (within sampled geographic units),
but, we avoid these details in this handbook for the sake of clarity of
illustration. Modifications of TL methodology for biased samples, repeated
measures, and related complications, are readily available.

We have 28 variables measured, of which a single variable is set to
be the outcome of interest. This outcome, \(Y\), is the weight-for-height Z-score
(\passthrough{\lstinline!whz!} in \passthrough{\lstinline!dat!}); the treatment of interest, \(A\), is the randomized treatment
group (\passthrough{\lstinline!tr!} in \passthrough{\lstinline!dat!}); and the adjustment set (potential baseline confounders),
\(W\), consists simply of \emph{everything else}. This results in our observed data
structure being \(n\) i.i.d. copies of \(O_i = (W_i, A_i, Y_i)\), for \(i = 1, \ldots, n\).

Using the \href{https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=skimr}{\passthrough{\lstinline!skimr!} package}, we can
quickly summarize the variables measured in the WASH Benefits data set:

\section*{Introduction}\label{introduction-1}}


The roadmap of statistical learning is concerned with the process of translating
real-world scientific questions to mathematical formalisms
necessary for formulating relevant statistical inference problems.
This involves viewing data as a random variable (complete with its own
underlying probability distribution), incorporating scientific knowledge into
the choice of statistical model, selecting a statistical target parameter that
represents an answer to the scientific question of interest, and developing
efficient estimators of the statistical estimand.

\hypertarget{roadmap-steps}{%
\section{The Roadmap}\label{roadmap-steps}}

The roadmap is a six-stage process:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Define the data as a random variable with a probability distribution, \(O \sim P_0\)
\item
  Specify the statistical model \(\M\) realistically, such that \(P_0 \in \M\)

  parameter \(\Psi\) and establish the target population
\item

\hypertarget{data-a-random-variable-with-a-probability-distribution-o-sim-p_0}{%
\subsection*{\texorpdfstring{(1) Data: A random variable with a probability distribution, \(O \sim P_0\)}{(1) Data: A random variable with a probability distribution, O \textbackslash sim P\_0}}\label{data-a-random-variable-with-a-probability-distribution-o-sim-p_0}}


The dataset we are confronted with is the collection of the results of a
scientific (or natural) experiment. We can view the data as a \emph{random variable};
that is, if the same experiment were to be repeated, we should expect to see a
different realization of the data generated by the same underlying law governing
the experiment in question. In particular, if the experiment were repeated many
times, the underlying probability distribution generating the data, \(P_0\), would
be revealed. The observed data on a single unit, \(O\), may be thought of as being
drawn from this probability distribution \(P_0\). Most often, we have \(n\)
\emph{independent and identically distributed} (i.i.d.) observations of the random
variable \(O\) in our dataset. Then, the observed data is the collection \(O_1, \ldots, O_n\), where the subscripts denote the individual observational units.
While not all data are i.i.d., this is certainly the most common case in applied
data analysis. There are a number of techniques for handling non-i.i.d. data,
including establishing conditional independence, such that conditional on some
variable (e.g., subject ID for repeated measures data) the i.i.d. assumption
holds, and incorporating inferential corrections for repeated or clustered
observations, to name but a few.

\hypertarget{the-empirical-probability-measure-p_n}{%
\subsubsection*{\texorpdfstring{The empirical probability measure, \(P_n\)}{The empirical probability measure, P\_n}}\label{the-empirical-probability-measure-p_n}}


With \(n\) i.i.d. observations in hand, we can define an empirical probability
measure, \(P_n\). The empirical probability measure is an approximation of the
true probability measure, \(P_0\), allowing us to learn from the observed data.
For example, we can define the empirical probability measure of a set of
variables, say \(W\), to be the proportion of observations that belong in \(W\).
That is,
\begin{equation*}
  P_n(W) = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n} \I(O_i \in W)
\end{equation*}

In order to understand the scope for learning from a particular dataset, we next
need to ask \emph{``What do we know about the process that led to the data's
generation?''} This brings us on to Step 2.

\hypertarget{defining-the-statistical-model-m-such-that-p_0-in-m}{%
\subsection*{\texorpdfstring{(2) Defining the statistical model \(\M\) such that \(P_0 \in \M\)}{(2) Defining the statistical model \textbackslash M such that P\_0 \textbackslash in \textbackslash M}}\label{defining-the-statistical-model-m-such-that-p_0-in-m}}


The statistical model \(\M\) is the set of all possible probability distributions
that could describe the process by which our observed data have been generated,
appropriately constrained by background scientific knowledge. Often, \(\M\) is
necessarily very large (i.e., non-parametric), reflecting the fact that
statistical knowledge about \(P_0\) is limited.

If \(P_0\) is described by a finite number of parameters, then the statistical
model is referred to as \emph{parametric}. Such an assumption is made, for example,
by the proposition that \(O\) has a Normal distribution with mean \(\mu\) and
variance \(\sigma^2\). More generally, a parametric model may be defined as

\begin{equation*}
  \M(\theta) = \{P_{\theta} : \theta \in \R^d \},
\end{equation*}
which describes a constrained statistical model consisting of all distributions
\(P_{\theta}\) that are indexed by some finite, \(d\)-dimensional parameter
\(\theta\).

The assumption that \(P_0\) has a specific, parametric form is made quite
commonly. Unfortunately, this is even the case when such assumptions are not
supported by domain knowledge about the data-generating process. This practice
of oversimplification in the current, and traditional, culture of statistical
data analysis typically complicates or entirely thwarts any attempt to reliably
answer the scientific question at hand. Why, you ask? Consider how much
knowledge one must have to \emph{know} (beyond a shadow of a doubt) that the
data-generating distribution underlying a given dataset is, in fact, governed by
just two parameters, as is the case with the ubiquitously relied upon Normal
distribution. Similarly, main terms Cox proportional hazards, logistic
regression, and linear models imply a highly constrained statistical model, and
if any of the assumptions are unwarranted then there will be bias in their
result (except when treatment is randomized). The philosophy used to justify
parametric assumptions is rooted in misinterpretations of the often-quoted
saying of George Box, that ``All models are wrong but some are useful,'' which has
been irresponsibly used to encourage the data analyst to make arbitrary modeling
choices. However, when one makes such unfounded assumptions, it is more likely
that \(\M\) does not contain \(P_0\), in which case the statistical model is said to
be misspecified. Statistical model misspecification introduces a bias that leads
to misleading, unreliable results and inference.

The result of unwarranted assumptions and oversimplifications is a practice of
statistical data science in which starkly disparate answers to the same
scientific problem emerge. Practically, this is owed to the application of
distinct statistical techniques under differing modeling decisions and
assumptions made (but not communicated well) by different data analysts. Even in
the nascent days of statistical data analysis, it was recognized that it is ``far
better {[}to develop{]} an approximate answer to the right question\ldots than an exact
answer to the wrong question, which can always be made precise''
\citep{tukey1962future}, though traditional statistics failed to heed this advice for
a number of decades \citep{donoho2017fifty}. The roadmap avoids this bias by defining
the statistical model through a representation of the true data-generating
distribution underlying the observed data. The ultimate goal is to formulate the
statistical estimation problem \emph{precisely} (up to the constraints imposed by
available scientific knowledge), so that one can then tailor the estimation
procedure to the motivating scientific problem.

It is crucial that the domain scientist(s) have absolute clarity about what is
\emph{actually known} about the process/experiment that generated the data, and that
this is communicated to data scientists with as much detail as possible. This
knowledge is rarely ground truth itself, but instead comes in the form of
scientific conventions, accepted hypotheses, and operational assumptions.
It is then the data scientist's responsibility to translate the domain knowledge
into statistical knowledge about \(P_0\), and then to define the statistical model
\(\M\) so that it respects what is known about \(P_0\) and makes no further
restrictions. In this manner, we can ensure that \(P_0\) is contained in \(\M\),
which we refer to generally as defining a \emph{realistic} statistical model \(\M\).

Defining \(\M\) realistically requires a shift in the paradigm of statistical
problem solving. Instead of considering the methods/software one is familiar
with and then trying to solve most problems with that toolbox, one must obtain a
deep understanding of the experiment and scientific question first and then
formulate a plan for learning from the data in a way that respects this. This
requires statisticians to have not only solid methodological and theoretical
foundations, but good communication skills, as several meetings with domain
experts are typically required to review details of the study, possibly refine
of the question of interest, translate technical details, and interpret the
findings in a way that is statistically correct and agreeable with
non-statistician domain experts. Unfortunately, communication between
statisticians and non-statistician researchers is often fraught with
misinterpretation. This is to be expected, as each have their own expertise, but
proper communication about the underlying science and the motivating study can
help to ensure each have appropriate context for a given statistical data
analysis. The roadmap provides a principled mechanism for learning from data
realistically, so that what is learned from the data represents a reliable and
reproducible approximation of the answer to the scientific question of interest.
As the roadmap provides a rigorous method for translating scientific knowledge
and questions into a statistical framework that can be used to learn from data,
it is an invaluable tool to guide communication between statisticians and
non-statistician domain scientists. This brings us to our next step in the
roadmap, \emph{``What are we trying to learn from the data?''}

\hypertarget{the-statistical-target-parameter-psi-and-statistical-estimand-psi_0}{%
\subsection*{\texorpdfstring{(3) The statistical target parameter \(\Psi\) and statistical estimand \(\psi_0\)}{(3) The statistical target parameter \textbackslash Psi and statistical estimand \textbackslash psi\_0}}\label{the-statistical-target-parameter-psi-and-statistical-estimand-psi_0}}


The statistical target parameter, \(\Psi\), is defined as a mapping from the
statistical model, \(\M\), to the parameter space. Usually, the parameter space is
a real number (but not necessarily so), in which case we can formally define the
target parameter as the mapping \(\Psi: \M \rightarrow \R\). The statistical
estimand may be seen as a representation of the quantity that we wish to learn
from the data, the answer to a well-specified -- often causal -- question of
interest about a particular target population. In contrast to ordinary
statistical estimands, causal estimands require an extra set of assumptions to
allow for their \emph{identification from the observed data}. Based on causal models
\citep{pearl2009causality, hernan2022causal}, identification assumptions are
untestable and must be justified through a combination of knowledge about the
system under study or the process by which the experiment was conducted. These
assumptions are described in greater detail in the following section on \protect\hyperlink{causal}{causal
target parameters}.

For a simple example, consider a dataset containing observations of a survival
time on every adult, for which our question of interest is ``What's the
probability that an adult lives longer than five years?'' We have,

\begin{equation*}
  \psi_0 = \Psi(P_0) = \E_{P_0}(O > 5) = \int_5^{\infty} dP_0(o).
\end{equation*}

This answer to this question is the \textbf{statistical estimand,
\(\Psi(P_0)=\psi_0\)}, which is the quantity we wish to learn from the data. As
discussed above, back-and-forth communication between domain scientists and
statisticians is often required to define \(\M\) realistically, and to finalize
\(\Psi\) and the target population such that the question is supported in the
data. For instance, say we are interested in learning the average effect of a
headache medication for treating migraines in adults and we learn that no one
with high blood pressure can receive the medication. In the next meeting with
domain scientists, we might suggest that the target population be modified to
adults without high blood pressure or ask a question involving a dynamic
treatment such that within \(\Psi\) adults with high blood pressure are never
considered as individuals who could receive treatment. Once we have defined \(O\),
\(\M\) realistically and \(\Psi\), we have formally defined the statistical
estimation problem. Next comes Step 4: ``\emph{How do we learn from the data the
approximate answer to the question of interest?}''

\hypertarget{the-estimator-hatpsi-and-estimate-psi_n}{%
\subsection*{\texorpdfstring{(4) The estimator \(\hat{\Psi}\) and estimate \(\psi_n\)}{(4) The estimator \textbackslash hat\{\textbackslash Psi\} and estimate \textbackslash psi\_n}}\label{the-estimator-hatpsi-and-estimate-psi_n}}


To obtain a good approximation of the statistical estimand, we need an estimator
\(\hat{\Psi}\), an \emph{a priori}-specified algorithm defined as a mapping from the set
of the set of possible empirical distributions \(P_n\) (which live in a
non-parametric statistical model \(\M_{NP}\)) to the parameter space for our
target parameter of interest: \(\hat{\Psi} : \M_{NP} \rightarrow \R\). In other
words, \(\hat{\Psi}\) is a function that takes as input the observed data, a
realization of \(P_n\), and then outputs a value in the parameter space. Where the
estimator may be seen as an operator that maps the observed data's corresponding
empirical distribution to a value in the parameter space, the numerical output
produced by such a function is the \textbf{estimate, \(\hat{\Psi}(P_n)=\psi_n\)}. Thus,
\(\psi_n\) is an element of the parameter space as informed by the empirical
probability distribution \(P_n\) of the observed data \(O_1, \ldots, O_n\). If we
plug in a realization of \(P_n\) (based on a sample size \(n\) of the random
variable \(O\), we get back an estimate \(\psi_n\) of the true parameter value
\(\psi_0\).
As we have motivated in step 2, it is imperative to consider realistic
statistical models for estimation. Therefore, flexible estimators that allow for
parts of the data-generating process to be unrestricted are necessary.
Semiparametric theory and empirical process theory provide a framework for
constructing, benchmarking, and understanding the behavior of estimators that
depend on flexible estimation strategies in realistic statistical models. In
general, desirable properties of an estimator are that it is regular
asymptotically linear (RAL) and efficient, thereby admitting a Normal limit
distribution that has minimal variance. Substitution/plug-in RAL estimators are
also advantageous: they are guaranteed to remain within the bounds of \(\M\) and,
relative to estimators that are not plug-in, have improved bias and variance in
finite samples. In-depth discussion of the theory and these properties are
available in the literature \citep[e.g.,][]{kennedy2016semiparametric, vdl2011targeted}. We review a few key concepts in the following step.

In order to quantify the uncertainty in our estimate of the target parameter,
part of the process of conducting statistical inference, an understanding of the
sampling distribution of our estimator is necessary. This brings us to Step 5:
``\emph{How confident should we be in our statistical answer to the scientific
question?}''

\hypertarget{a-measure-of-uncertainty-for-the-estimate-psi_n}{%
\subsection*{\texorpdfstring{(5) A measure of uncertainty for the estimate \(\psi_n\)}{(5) A measure of uncertainty for the estimate \textbackslash psi\_n}}\label{a-measure-of-uncertainty-for-the-estimate-psi_n}}


Since the estimator \(\hat{\Psi}\) is a function of the empirical distribution
\(P_n\), the estimator itself is a random variable with a sampling distribution.
Therefore, if we repeat the experiment of drawing \(n\) observations, we would
every time end up with a different realization of our estimate. The hypothetical
distribution of these estimates is the sampling distribution of the estimator.

A primary goal in the construction of estimators is to be able to derive their
asymptotic sampling distribution through a theoretical analysis involving
empirical process theory. In this regard, an important property of the
estimators on which we focus is their asymptotic linearity. In particular,
asymptotic linearity states that the difference between the estimator and the
target parameter (i.e., the truth) can be represented, asymptotically, as an
average of i.i.d. random variables plus an asymptotically negligible remainder
term:

\begin{equation*}
  \hat{\Psi}(P_n) - \Psi(P_0) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n IC(P_0)(O_i) +
    o_p(n^{-1/2}),
\end{equation*}
where the influence curve (IC) is a function of the observed data \(O\) but the
function itself is defined by the underlying data-generating distribution \(P_0\).
Based on this asymptotic approximation, the Central Limit Theorem can be used to
show

\begin{equation*}
  \sqrt{n} \left(\hat{\Psi}(P_n) - \Psi(P_0)\right) \sim N(0, \sigma^2_{IC}),
\end{equation*}
where \(\sigma^2_{IC}\) is the variance of \(IC(P_0)(O)\). Given an estimate of
\(\sigma^2_{IC}\), it is then possible to construct classic, \emph{asymptotically
accurate} Wald-type confidence intervals (CIs) and hypothesis tests. For
example, a standard \((1 - \alpha)\) CI takes the form

\begin{equation*}
  \psi_n \pm Z \frac{\hat{\sigma}_{IC}}{\sqrt{n}} \ ,
\end{equation*}
where \(Z\) is the \((1 - \alpha / 2)^\text{th}\) quantile of the standard Normal
distribution. Following convention, we will often be interested in constructing
95\% two-tailed CIs, corresponding to probability mass \(\alpha/2 = 0.025\) in each
tail of the limit distribution; thus, we will take \(Z \approx 1.96\) as the
quantile.

Steps (1)--(5) of the roadmap define the statistical analysis plan, all of which
can be done before any data is revealed. The last step of the roadmap involves
interpreting the results obtained in step (4) and (5) and therefore requires the
data to be analyzed; however, any additional analysis that may take place as
part of step (6) can be pre-specified as well. This final step of the roadmap
addresses the question, ``\emph{what is the interpretation and robustness of the
study's findings, and what conclusions can be drawn from them?}''

\hypertarget{make-substantive-conclusion}{%
\subsection*{(6) Make substantive conclusion}\label{make-substantive-conclusion}}


Making the substantive conclusion involves interpreting the study findings. It
also provides an opportunity to ask follow-up questions that might be addressed
later and/or discuss issues that can inform future studies. Statistical
estimands \(\psi_0\) can have statistical (noncausal) and causal interpretations.
Both are often of interest and can be provided. The target population should be
clearly mentioned in the interpretation, regardless of whether it's a purely
statistical or causal interpretation, to curtail extrapolation of results.

The major distinction between statistical versus causal interpretations is that
the latter relies on untestable so-called ``identifiability'' assumptions. In the
following section, we review these assumptions one-by-one. Here, we focus on the
interpretation and robustness of the study findings with respect to them.
Specifically, causal target parameters cannot be estimated from observed data
without additional identifiability assumptions, and so the validity of a
result's causal interpretation hinges on them holding in the data. The more
these assumptions do not hold, the larger the \emph{causal gap}, the difference
between the statistical estimand and the causal estimand. In a perfect
randomized control trial with no loss to follow-up, the causal gap will be zero
as the statistical and causal estimands are equivalent. In \citet{diaz2013sensitivity},
a non-parametric sensitivity analysis for assessing the impact of a hypothesized
causal gaps on estimates and inference is proposed. In \citet{gruber2022targeted} and
\citet{gruber2022evaluating}, there are example implementations of the methods proposed
in \citet{diaz2013sensitivity}; in particular, the difference between adjusted and
unadjusted effect estimates is used to define a range of possible causal gaps
relative to this difference. If the question of interest is causal, then such a
model-free sensitivity analysis (possibly as a complement to other sensitivity
analyses) is recommended to assess the robustness of the study findings.

\hypertarget{roadmap-summary}{%
\section{Summary of the Roadmap}\label{roadmap-summary}}

Data collected across \(n\) i.i.d. units, \(O_1, \ldots, O_n\), may be viewed as a
collection of random variables arising from the same underlying probability
distribution \(\P_0\). This is expressed by denoting the collection of data as
being generated as \(O_1, \ldots, O_n \sim P_0\). Domain knowledge about the
experiment that generated the data (e.g., if the treatment was randomized, if
the treatment decision or loss to follow-up depended on a subset of covariates,
time ordering in which the variables were added to the data) is translated by
the statistician / data scientist to define the statistical model \(\M\), a
postulated space of candidate probability distributions that is supposed to
contain \(P_0\). In particular, the roadmap emphasizes the critical role of
defining \(\M\) such that \(P_0\) is guaranteed to be encapsulated by it, \(P_0 \in \M\). By only limiting \(\M\) based on domain knowledge about the experiment (i.e.,
reality) --- opposed to constraining it unrealistically (e.g., assuming a
restrictive functional form, like a main terms linear/logistic model, describes
\(P_0\)) --- it can be ensured that \(P_0 \in \M\), and we refer to this as defining
a realistic statistical model. Often, knowledge that can be used to constrain
\(\M\) is very limited, and so \(\M\) must be very large to define it such that \(P_0 \in \M\); hence, realistic statistical models are often termed semi- or
non-parametric, since they are too large to be indexed by a finite-dimensional
set of parameters. Necessarily, our statistical query must begin with, ``What are
we trying to learn from the data?'', a question whose answer is captured by the
statistical target parameter, \(\Psi\), a function defined by the true
data-generating distribution \(P_0\), that maps \(\M\) into the statistical
estimand, \(\psi_0\). At this stage, the statistical estimation problem is
formally defined, allowing for the use of statistical theory to guide the
construction of estimators, which are algorithms that approximate the answer the
question of interest by learning from the data. Desirable properties of an
estimator are that it is unbiased, efficient, plug-in, and robust in finite
samples. If the question of interest is causal, then a model-free sensitivity
analysis is recommended to assess the robustness of the study's findings under
various hypothesized causal gaps.

\hypertarget{causal}{%
\section{Causal Target Parameters}\label{causal}}

In many cases, we are interested in problems that ask questions regarding the
\emph{causal effect} of an intervention, whether an assigned treatment (e.g., a
prescribed drug) or a ``naturally occurring'' exposure (e.g., pollution from a
nearby factory), on a future outcome of interest. These causal effects may be
defined as summaries of the population of interest (e.g., population mean of a
particular outcome) under contrasting interventions (e.g., comparing the treated
to the untreated condition). For example, a causal effect could be defined as
the mean difference of a disease outcome between two \emph{causal contrasts},
counterfactual cases in which the study population were set to uniformly
experience low pollution levels for some pollutant, and in which the same
population were set to uniformly experience high levels of the same pollutant.

There are different ways of operationalizing the theoretical experiments that
generate the counterfactual data necessary for describing such causal contrasts
of interest. We could simply assume that the counterfactual outcomes exist in
theory for all treatment contrasts of interest \citep{neyman1938contribution, rubin2005causal, imbens2015causal}, which may be encoded in so-called ``science
tables''. Alternatively, we could consider interventions on structural causal
models (SCMs) \citep{pearl1995causal, pearl2009causality}, which may be represented
by directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). Both frameworks allow for the known or
hypothesized set of relationships between variables in the system under study to
be encoded and mathematically formalized.

\hypertarget{the-causal-model}{%
\subsection*{The Causal Model}\label{the-causal-model}}


Throughout, we will focus on the use of DAGs and SCMs for the description of
causal parameters. Estimators of statistical parameters that correspond, under
standard but untestable \emph{identifiability} assumptions, to these causal
parameters are introduced below. DAGs are a particularly useful tool for
visually expressing what we know about the causal relations among variables in
the system under study. Ignoring exogenous \(U\) terms (explained below), we
assume the following ordering of the variables that compose the observed data
\(O\). We demonstrate the construction of a DAG below using \passthrough{\lstinline!DAGitty!}
\citep{textor2011dagitty}:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=R]
library(dagitty)
library(ggdag)

# make DAG by specifying dependence structure
dag <- dagitty(
  "dag {
    W -> A
    W -> Y
    A -> Y
    W -> A -> Y
  }"
)
exposures(dag) <- c("A")
outcomes(dag) <- c("Y")
tidy_dag <- tidy_dagitty(dag)

# visualize DAG
ggdag(tidy_dag) +
  theme_dag()
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=0.6\linewidth]{04-roadmap_files/figure-latex/simple-DAG-1} \end{center}

While DAGs like the above provide a convenient means by which to express the
causal relations between variables, these same causal relations can be
equivalently represented by an SCM:
\begin{align*}
  W &= f_W(U_W) \\
  A &= f_A(W, U_A) \\
  Y &= f_Y(W, A, U_Y),
\end{align*}
where the \(f\)'s are unspecified deterministic functions that generate the
corresponding random variables as a function of the variable's ``parents'' (i.e.,
upstream nodes with arrows into the given random variable) in the DAG, and the
unobserved, exogenous error terms (i.e., the \(U\)'s). An SCM may be thought of as
a representation of the algorithm that produces the data, \(O\), in the population
of interest. Much of statistics and data science is devoted to discovering
properties of this system of equations (e.g., estimation of the functional form
\(f_Y\) governing the outcome variable \(Y\)).

The first hypothetical experiment we will consider is assigning exposure to the
entire population and observing the outcome, and then withholding exposure to
the same population and observing the outcome. This corresponds to a comparison
of the outcome distribution in the population under two distinct interventions:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \(A\) is set to \(1\) for all individuals, and
\item
  \(A\) is set to \(0\) for all individuals.
\end{enumerate}

These interventions may be thought of as operations that imply changes
to the structural equations in the system under study. For the case \(A = 1\), we
have
\begin{align*}
  W &= f_W(U_W) \\
  A &= 1 \\
  Y(1) &= f_Y(W, 1, U_Y) \ ,
\end{align*}
while, for the case \(A=0\),
\begin{align*}
  W &= f_W(U_W) \\
  A &= 0 \\
  Y(0) &= f_Y(W, 0, U_Y) \ .
\end{align*}

In these equations, \(A\) is no longer a function of \(W\) because the intervention
on the system set \(A\) deterministically
to one of the values \(1\) or \(0\) consistent with the intervention performed. The
new symbols \(Y(1)\) and \(Y(0)\) indicate the values the outcome variable would
take in the population of interest when it is generated by removing the
contribution of \(A\) to \(f_Y\) and instead setting \(A\) to the values \(1\) and \(0\),
respectively. The variables \(Y(1)\) and \(Y(0)\) are often called counterfactuals
(since they arise from interventions that run contrary to fact) and are, in
other frameworks, called the \emph{potential outcomes} of \(Y\)
{[}\citet{neyman1938contribution}; rubin2005causal; imbens2015causal{]}. The difference in
the counterfactual means of the outcome under these two interventions defines a
well known causal parameter that is most often called the ``average treatment
effect'' (ATE) and is denoted

\begin{equation}
  ATE = \E_X[Y(1) - Y(0)],
  \label{eq:ate}
\end{equation}
where \(\E_X(\cdot)\) is the expectation taken over the theoretical (unobservable)
full data (i.e., \(X = (W, Y(1), Y(0))\)) distribution \(P_X\). Note that the full
data structure \(X\) is, by its very definition, unobservable since one can never
observe both of \(Y(1)\) and \(Y(0)\) for the same observational unit.

We can define much more complicated interventions on SCMs, such as interventions
based upon dynamic rules (which assign particular interventions based on a
function of the covariates \(W\)), stochastic rules (which can even account for
the natural value of \(A\) observed in the absence of the intervention), and much
more. Each results in a different target causal parameter and entails different
identifiability assumptions discussed below.

\hypertarget{identifiability}{%
\subsection*{Identifiability}\label{identifiability}}


Since we can never simultaneously observe \(Y(0)\), the counterfactual outcome
when \(A=0\), and \(Y(1)\), the counterfactual outcome when \(A=1\), we cannot
estimate their difference \(Y(1) - Y(0)\) (the individual treatment effect), which
appears in Equation \eqref{eq:ate} (inside the expectation \(\E_X(\cdot)\) that
defines ATE). This is called the \emph{Fundamental Problem of Causal Inference}
\citep{holland1986statistics}. Thus, one of the primary activities in causal
inference is to \emph{identify} the assumptions necessary to express causal
quantities of interest as functions of the data-generating distribution of the
observed data. To do this, we must make assumptions under which such quantities
may be estimated from the observed data \(O \sim P_0\) and its corresponding
data-generating distribution \(P_0\). Fortunately, given the causal model
specified in the SCM above, we can, with a handful of untestable assumptions,
estimate the ATE from observational data. These assumptions may be summarized as
follows.

\begin{definition}[Consistency]
\protect\hypertarget{def:consist-ass}{}\label{def:consist-ass}The outcome for unit \(i\) is \(Y_i(a)\) whenever \(A_i = a\), which may be thought of
as ``no other versions of treatment'' or ``no side effects of treatment.''
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[No Interference]
\protect\hypertarget{def:interf-ass}{}\label{def:interf-ass}The outcome for unit \(i\), \(Y_i\), cannot be affected by the exposure of unit \(j\),
\(A_j\), for all \(i \neq j\).
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[No Unmeasured Confounding]
\protect\hypertarget{def:noconf-ass}{}\label{def:noconf-ass}\(A \perp Y(a) \mid W\) for all \(a \in \mathcal{A}\), which states that the
potential outcomes \((Y(a) : a \in \mathcal{A})\) arise independently from
exposure status \(A\), conditional on the observed covariates \(W\). This is the
analog of the \emph{randomization} assumption in data arising from natural
experiments, ensuring that the effect of \(A\) on \(Y\) can be disentangled from
that of \(W\) on \(Y\), even though \(W\) affects both.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Positivity/Overlap]
\protect\hypertarget{def:posit-ass}{}\label{def:posit-ass}All observed units, across strata defined by \(W\), must have a bounded
probability of receiving treatment -- that is, \(\epsilon < \P(A = a \mid W) < 1 - \epsilon\) for all \(a\) and \(W\) and for some \(\epsilon > 0\)) ~.
\end{definition}

Technically speaking, only the latter two of these assumptions are necessary
when working within the SCM framework, as the first two are implied properties
of an SCM for i.i.d. data (if you're really curious, see this commentary of
\citet{pearl2010brief} for an extended discussion). We introduce all four
identification assumptions because they are most often considered together, and
all four are necessary when working within the potential outcomes framework
\citep{rubin2005causal, imbens2015causal}.

Under these assumptions, the ATE may be re-written as a function of \(P_0\), the
distribution of the observed data:

\begin{align}
  \psi_{\text{ATE}} &= \E_0[Y(1) - Y(0)] \\ \nonumber
                    &= \E_0 [\E_0[Y \mid A = 1, W] -
                       \E_0[Y \mid A = 0, W]] \ .
  \label{eq:estimand}
\end{align}
In words, the ATE is the mean difference in the predicted outcome values for
each subject, under the contrast of treatment conditions (\(A = 0\) versus \(A = 1\)), in the population (when averaged over all observations). Thus, a parameter
of a theoretical complete (or ``full'') data distribution can be represented as an
estimand of the observed data distribution. Significantly, there is nothing
about the representation in Equation \eqref{eq:estimand} that requires
parameteric assumptions; thus, the regression functions on the right hand side
may be estimated without restrictive assumptions about their underlying
functional forms. With different parameters, there will be potentially
different identifiability assumptions and the resulting estimands can be
functions of different components of \(P_0\). We discuss several more complex
estimands in subsequent chapters.

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction-2}}

Following the \protect\hyperlink{roadmap}{\emph{Roadmap for Targeted Learning}}, we start to elaborate
on the estimation step in the current chapter. In order to generate an estimate
of the target parameter, we need to decide how to evaluate the quality of our
estimation procedure's performance. The performance, or error, of any algorithm
(estimator) corresponds to its generalizability to independent datasets arising
from the same data-generating process. Assessment of the performance of an
algorithm is extremely important --- it provides a quantitative measure of how
well the algorithm performs, and it guides the choice of selecting among a set
(or ``library'') of algorithms. In order to assess the performance of an
algorithm, or a library of them, we introduce the concept of a \textbf{loss
function}, which defines the \textbf{risk} or the \textbf{expected prediction error}.
Our goal is to estimate the true performance (risk) of our estimator. In the
next chapter, we elaborate on how to estimate the performance of a library of
algorithms in order to choose the best-performing one. In the following, we
propose a method to do so using the observed data and \textbf{cross-validation}
procedures implemented in the \passthrough{\lstinline!origami!} package \citep{coyle2018origami, coyle-cran-origami}.

\hypertarget{background}{%
\section{Background}\label{background}}

Ideally, in a data-rich scenario (i.e., one with unlimited observations), we
would split our dataset into three parts:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  the training set,
\item
  the validation set, and
\item
  the test (or holdout) set.
\end{enumerate}

The training set is used to fit algorithm(s) of interest; we evaluate the
performance of the fit(s) on a validation set, which can be used to estimate
prediction error (e.g., for algorithm tuning or selection). The final error of
the selected algorithm is obtained by using the test (or holdout) set, which is
kept entirely separate such that the algorithms never encounter these
observations until the final model evaluation step. One might wonder, with
training data readily available, why not use the training error to evaluate the
proposed algorithm's performance? Unfortunately, the training error is a biased
estimate of a fitted algorithm's generalizability, since it uses the same data
for fitting and evaluation.

Since data are often scarce, separating a dataset into training, validation and
test sets can prove too limiting, on account of decreasing the available data
for use in training by too much. In the absence of a large dataset and a
designated test set, we must resort to methods that estimate the algorithm's
true performance by efficient sample re-use. Re-sampling methods, like the
bootstrap, involve repeatedly sampling from the training set and fitting the
algorithms to these samples. While often computationally intensive, re-sampling
methods are particularly useful for evaluating an algorithm and selecting among
a set of them. In addition, they provide more insight on the variability and
robustness of a fitted algorithm, relative to fitting an algorithm only once to
all of the training data.

\hypertarget{introducing-cross-validation}{%
\subsection{Introducing: cross-validation}\label{introducing-cross-validation}}

In this chapter, we focus on \textbf{cross-validation} --- an essential tool for
evaluating how any algorithm extends from a sample of data to the target
population from which it arose. Cross-validation has seen widespread
application in all facets of modern statistics, and perhaps most notably in
statistical machine learning. The cross-validation procedure has been proven to
be optimal for algorithm selection in large samples, i.e.~asymptotically.
In particular,cross-validated algorithm estimates the true risk when the
estimate is applied to an independent sample from the joint distribution of
the predictors and outcome.

When used for model selection, cross-validation has powerful optimality
properties. The asymptotic optimality results state that the cross-validated
selector performs (in terms of risk) asymptotically as well as an optimal oracle
selector --- a hypothetical procedure with free access to the true, unknown
data-generating distribution. For further details on the theoretical results, we
suggest consulting \citet{vdl2003unified}, \citet{vdl2004asymptotic}, \citet{dudoit2005asymptotics}
and \citet{vaart2006oracle}.

The \passthrough{\lstinline!origami!} package provides a suite of tools for cross-validation. In the
following, we describe different types of cross-validation schemes readily
available in \passthrough{\lstinline!origami!}, introduce the general structure of the \passthrough{\lstinline!origami!}
package, and demonstrate the use of these procedures in various applied
settings.

\hypertarget{estimation-roadmap-how-does-it-all-fit-together}{%
\section{Estimation Roadmap: How does it all fit together?}\label{estimation-roadmap-how-does-it-all-fit-together}}

Similarly to how we defined the \protect\hyperlink{roadmap}{\emph{Roadmap for Targeted Learning}}, we
can define the \textbf{Estimation Roadmap} as a guide for the estimation process. In
particular, the unified loss-based estimation framework \citep{vdl2003unified, vdl2004asymptotic, dudoit2005asymptotics, vaart2006oracle, vdl2007super},
which relies on cross-validation for estimator construction,
selection, and performance assessment, consists of three main steps:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \textbf{Loss function}:
  Define the target parameter as the minimizer of the expected loss (risk) for a
  full data loss function chosen to represent the desired performance measure. By
  full data, we refer to the complete data including missingness process, for
  example. Map the full data loss function into an observed data loss function,
  having the same expected value and leading to an estimator of risk.
\item
  \textbf{Algorithms}:
  Construct a finite collection of candidate estimators of the parameter of
  interest.
\item
  \textbf{Cross-validation scheme}:
  Apply appropriate cross-validation, and use the cross-validated risk in
  order to select the best performing estimator among the candidates. Assess
  the overall performance of the resulting estimator.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{example-cross-validation-and-prediction}{%
\section{Example: Cross-validation and Prediction}\label{example-cross-validation-and-prediction}}

Having introduced the \protect\hyperlink{roadmap}{Estimation Roadmap}, we can more precisely
define our objective using prediction as an example. Let the observed data be
defined as \(O = (W, Y)\), where a unit specific data structure can be written as
\(O_i = (W_i, Y_i)\), for \(i = 1, \ldots, n\). We denote \(Y_i\) as the
outcome/dependent variable of interest, and \(W_i\) as a \(p\)-dimensional set of
covariate (predictor) variables. We assume the \(n\) units are independent, or
conditionally independent, and identically distributed. Let \(\psi_0(W)\) denote
the target parameter of interest, the quantity we wish to estimate (estimand).
For this example, we are interested in estimating the conditional expectation of
the outcome given the covariates, \(\psi_0(W) = \E(Y \mid W)\). Following the
\protect\hyperlink{roadmap}{Estimation Roadmap}, we choose the appropriate loss function, \(L\),
such that \(\psi_0(W) = \text{argmin}_{\psi} \E_0[L(O, \psi(W))]\). Note that
\(\psi_0(W)\), the true target parameter, is a minimizer of the risk (expected
value of the chosen loss function). The appropriate loss function for
conditional expectation with continuous outcome could be a mean squared error,
for example. Then we can define \(L\) as \(L(O, \psi(W)) = (Y_i -\psi(W_i)^2\). Note
that there can be many different algorithms which estimate the estimand (many
different \(\psi\)s). How do we know how well each of the candidate estimators of
\(\psi_0(W)\) are doing? To pick the best-performing candidate estimator and
assess its overall performance, we use cross-validation. Observations in the
training set are used to fit (or train) the estimator, while those in validation
set are used to assess the risk of (or validate) it.

Next, we introduce notation flexible enough to represent any cross-validation
scheme. In particular, we define a \textbf{split vector}, \(B_n = (B_n(i): i = 1, \ldots, n) \in \{0,1\}^n\).
A realization of \(B_n\) defines a random split of the data into training and
validation subsets such that if
\[B_n(i) = 0, \ \ \text{i sample is in the training set}\]
\[B_n(i) = 1, \ \ \text{i sample is in the validation set.}\]
We can further define \(P_{n, B_n}^0\) and \(P_{n, B_n}^1\) as the empirical
distributions of the training and validation sets, respectively. Then, \(n_0 = \sum_i (1 - B_n(i))\) and \(n_1 = \sum_i B_n(i)\) denote the number of samples in
the training and validation sets, respectively. The particular distribution
of the split vector \(B_n\) defines the type of cross-validation scheme, tailored
to the problem and dataset at hand.

\hypertarget{cross-validation-schemes-in-origami}{%
\section{\texorpdfstring{Cross-validation schemes in \texttt{origami}}{Cross-validation schemes in origami}}\label{cross-validation-schemes-in-origami}}

A variety of different partitioning schemes exist, each tailored to the salient
details of the problem of interest, including data size, prevalence of the
outcome, and dependence structure (between units or across time). In the
following, we describe different cross-validation schemes available in the
\passthrough{\lstinline!origami!} package, and we go on to demonstrate their use in practical data
analysis examples.

\hypertarget{wash-benefits-study-example}{%
\subsection*{WASH Benefits Study Example}\label{wash-benefits-study-example}}


In order to illustrate different cross-validation schemes, we will be using the
WASH Benefits example dataset (detailed information can be found in
\protect\hyperlink{wash}{Chapter 3}). In particular, we are interested in predicting
weight-for-height Z-score (\passthrough{\lstinline!whz!}) using the available covariate data. For this
illustration, we will start by treating the data as independent and identically
distributed (i.i.d.) random draws from an unknown distribution \(P_0\). To
see what each cross-validation scheme is doing, we will subset the data to only
\(n=30\). Note that each row represents an i.i.d. sampled unit, indexed by the row
number.

\hypertarget{re-substitution}{%
\subsubsection{Re-substitution}\label{re-substitution}}

The re-substitution method is perhaps the simplest strategy for estimating the
risk of a fitted algorithm. With
this cross-validation scheme, all observed data units are used in both the
training and validation set.

We illustrate the usage of the re-substitution method with \passthrough{\lstinline!origami!} below,
using the function \passthrough{\lstinline!folds\_resubstitution!}. In order to set up
\passthrough{\lstinline!folds\_resubstitution!}, we need only to specify the total number of sampled
units that we want to allocate to the training and validation sets; remember
that each row of the dataset is a unique i.i.d. sampled unit. Also, notice the
structure of the \passthrough{\lstinline!origami!} output:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{v:} the cross-validation fold
\item
  \textbf{training\_set:} the indices of the samples in the training set
\item
  \textbf{validation\_set:} the indices of the samples in the training set.
\end{enumerate}

The structure of the \passthrough{\lstinline!origami!} output, a \passthrough{\lstinline!list!} of fold(s), holds across all of
the cross-validation schemes presented in this chapter. Below, we show the fold
generated by the re-substitution method:

\hypertarget{holdout}{%
\subsubsection{Holdout}\label{holdout}}

The holdout method, or the validation set approach, consists of randomly
dividing the available data into training and validation (holdout) sets. The
model is then fitted (i.e., ``trained'') using the observations in the training
set and subsequently evaluated (i.e., ``validated'') using the observations in the
validation set. Typically, the dataset is split into \(60:40\), \(70:30\), \(80:20\)
or even \(90:10\) training-to-validation splits.

The holdout method is intuitive and computationally inexpensive; however, it
does carry a disadvantage: If we were to repeat the process of randomly
splitting the data into training and validation sets, we could get very
different cross-validated estimates of the empirical risk. In particular, the
empirical mean of the loss function (i.e., the empirical risk) evaluated over
the validation set(s) could be highly variable, depending on which samples were
included in the training and validation splits. Overall, the cross-validated
empirical risk for the holdout method is more variable, since in includes
variability of the random split as well --- this is not desirable. For
classification problems (with a binary or categorical outcome variable), there
is an additional disadvantage: it is possible for the training and validation
sets to end up with uneven distributions of the two (or more) outcome classes,
leading to better training and poor validation, or vice-versa --- though this may
be corrected by incorporating stratification into the cross-validation process.
Finally, note that we are not using all of the data in training or in evaluating
the performance of the proposed algorithm, which could itself introduce bias.

\hypertarget{leave-one-out}{%
\subsubsection{Leave-one-out}\label{leave-one-out}}

The leave-one-out cross-validation scheme is closely related to the holdout
method, as it also involves splitting the dataset into training and validation
sets; however, instead of partitioning the dataset into sets of similar size, a
single observation is used as the validation set. In doing so, the vast majority
of the sampled units are employed for fitting (or training) the candidate
learning algorithm. Since only a single sampled unit (for example \(O_1 = (W_1, Y_1)\)) is left out of the fitting process, leave-one-out cross-validation can
result in a less biased estimate of the risk. Typically, the
leave-one-out approach will not overestimate the risk as much as the holdout
method does. On the other hand, since the estimate of risk is based on a single
sampled unit, it is usually a highly variable estimate.

We can repeat the process of spiting the dataset into training and validation
sets until all of the sampled units have had a chance to act as the validation
set. Continuing the example above, a subsequent iteration of the leave-one-out
cross-validation scheme may use \(O_2 = (W_2, Y_2)\) as the validation set (where,
before, \(O_1 = (W_1, Y_1)\) played that role), while the remaining \(n-1\) sampled
units are included in the training set. Repeating this approach \(n\) times
results in \(n\) risk estimates, for example, \(MSE_1, MSE_2, \ldots, MSE_n\) (note
that these are the mean squared error (MSE) estimates when unit \(i\) is the
validation set). The estimate of the true risk is then the average over the \(n\)
leave-one-out risk estimates. While the leave-one-out cross-validation scheme
results in a less biased (albeit, more variable) estimate of risk than the
holdout method, it can be computationally very expensive to implement when \(n\)
is large.

We illustrate the usage of the leave-one-out cross-validation scheme with
\passthrough{\lstinline!origami!} below, using the \passthrough{\lstinline!folds\_loo(n)!} function. In order to set up
\passthrough{\lstinline!folds\_loo(n)!}, similarly to the case of the re-substitution method, we need
only the total number of sampled units over which the cross-validation procedure
is to operate. We show the first two folds generated by leave-one-out
cross-validation below.

\hypertarget{v-fold}{%
\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{\(V\)-fold}{V-fold}}\label{v-fold}}

An alternative to the leave-one-out scheme is \(V\)-fold cross-validation. This
cross-validation scheme randomly divides the dataset into \(V\) splits of
equal (or approximately equal) size. For each split \(v=1,\ldots,V\), the
\(v\)th fold is defined by the \(v\)th split (which defines the validation set for
fold \(v\)) and the complement of the \(v\)th split (which defines the training set
for fold \(v\)). The algorithms are fit \(V\) times separately, to each of the
\(V\) training sets. The risk of each fold's fitted algorithms is then evaluated
via predictions obtained from the validation set. The cross-validated risk for
a fitted algorithm, for example the MSE, is its average risk across all folds.
With \(V\)-fold cross-validation, all of the observations
are used in the training and validation stages, preventing the candidate
learning algorithm from overfitting to only a subset of the data (e.g., a given
training set).

For a dataset with \(n\) sampled units, \(V\)-fold cross-validation with \(v=n\)
merely reduces to leave-one-out. Similarly, if we set \(n=1\), we can get the
holdout method's estimate of the candidate learning algorithm's performance.
Beyond its computational advantages, \(V\)-fold cross-validation often yields more
accurate estimates of the true, underlying risk. This is rooted in the differing
bias-variance trade-offs associated with these two cross-validation schemes:
While the leave-one-out scheme may be less biased, it has much greater variance
(since only a single unit is included in the validation set). This difference
becomes more obvious as \(n\) becomes much greater than \(v\). With the \(V\)-fold
cross-validation scheme, we end up averaging risk estimates across the \(v\)
validation folds, which are typically less correlated than the risk estimates
from the leave-one-out fits. Owing to the fact that the mean of many highly
correlated quantities has higher variance, leave-one-out estimates of the risk
will have higher variance than the corresponding estimates based on \(V\)-fold
cross-validation.

Now, let's see \(V\)-fold cross-validation with \passthrough{\lstinline!origami!} in action! In the next
chapter, we will turn to studying the Super Learner algorithm --- an algorithm
capable of selecting the ``best'' algorithm from among a large library of candidate
learning algorithms -- which we'd like to fit \emph{and} evaluate the performance of.
The Super Learner algorithm relies on \(V\)-fold cross-validation as its default
cross-validation scheme. In order to set up \(V\)-fold cross-validation, we need
to call \passthrough{\lstinline!origami!}'s \passthrough{\lstinline!folds\_vfold(n, V)!} function. The two required arguments for
\passthrough{\lstinline!folds\_vfold(n, V)!} are the total number of sample units to be cross-validated
and the number of folds we wish to have.

For example, at \(V=2\), we will get two folds, each with approximately \(n/2\)
sampled units in the training and validation sets.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=R]

\hypertarget{monte-carlo}{%
\subsubsection{Monte Carlo}\label{monte-carlo}}

In the Monte Carlo cross-validation scheme, we randomly select some fraction of
the data, \emph{without replacement}, to form the training set, assigning the
remainder of the sampled units to the validation set. In this way, the dataset
is randomly divided into two independent splits: A training set of \(n_0 = n \cdot (1 - p)\) observations and a validation set of \(n_1 = n \cdot p\)
observations. By repeating this procedure many times, the Monte Carlo
cross-validation scheme generates, at random, many training and validation
partitions of the dataset.

Since the partitions are independent across folds, the same observational unit
can appear in the validation set multiple times; note that this is a stark
difference between the Monte Carlo and \(V\)-fold cross-validation schemes. For a
given sampling fraction \(p\), the Monte Carlo cross-validation scheme would be
optimal if repeated infinitely many times --- of course, this is not
computationally feasible. With Monte Carlo cross-validation, it is possible to
explore many more partitions of the dataset than with \(V\)-fold cross-validation,
resulting in (possibly) less variable estimates of the risk (across partitions),
though this comes at the cost of an increase in bias (because the splits are
correlated). Because Monte Carlo cross-validation generates many splits with
overlaps in the sampled units, more splits (and thus more computational time)
will be necessary to achieve the level of performance (in terms of unbiasedness)
that the \(V\)-fold cross-validation scheme achieves with only \(V\) splits.

We illustrate the usage of the Monte Carlo cross-validation scheme with
\passthrough{\lstinline!origami!} below, using the \passthrough{\lstinline!folds\_montecarlo(n, V, pvalidation)!} function. In
order to set up \passthrough{\lstinline!folds\_montecarlo(n, V, pvalidation)!}, we need the following,

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  the total number of observations we wish to cross-validate;
\item
  the number of folds; and
\item
  the proportion of observations to be placed in the validation set.
\end{enumerate}

For example, setting \(V=2\) and \(pvalidation = 0.2\), we obtain two folds, each
with approximately \(6\) sampled units in the validation set for each fold.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=R]

\hypertarget{bootstrap}{%
\subsubsection{Bootstrap}\label{bootstrap}}

Like the Monte Carlo cross-validation scheme, the bootstrap cross-validation
scheme also consists of randomly selecting sampled units, \emph{with replacement},
for the training set; the rest of the sampled units are allocated to the
validation set. This process is then repeated multiple times, generating (at
random) new training and validation partitions of the dataset each time. In
contrast to the Monte Carlo cross-validation scheme, the total number of sampled
units in training and validation sets (i.e., the sizes of the two partitions)
across folds is not held constant. Also, as the name suggests, sampling is
performed with replacement (as in the bootstrap \citep{davison1997bootstrap}), hence
the exact same observational units may be included in multiple training sets.
The proportion of observational units in the validation sets is a random
variable, with expectation \(\sim 0.368\).

We illustrate the usage of the bootstrap cross-validation scheme with \passthrough{\lstinline!origami!}
below, using the \passthrough{\lstinline!folds\_bootstrap(n, V)!} function. In order to set up
\passthrough{\lstinline!folds\_bootstrap(n, V)!}, we need to specify the following arguments:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  the total number of observations we wish to cross-validate; and
\item
  the number of folds.
\end{enumerate}

For example, setting \(V=2\), we obtain two folds, each with different numbers of
sampled units in the validation sets across the folds.

\hypertarget{cross-validation-for-time-series-data}{%
\subsection{Cross-validation for Time-series Data}\label{cross-validation-for-time-series-data}}

The \passthrough{\lstinline!origami!} package also supports numerous cross-validation schemes for
time-series data, for both single and multiple time-series
with arbitrary time and network dependence.

\hypertarget{airpassenger-data-example}{%
\subsection*{\texorpdfstring{\texttt{AirPassenger} Data Example}{AirPassenger Data Example}}\label{airpassenger-data-example}}


In order to illustrate different cross-validation schemes for time-series, we
will be using the \emph{AirPassenger} data; this is a widely used, freely available
dataset. The \emph{AirPassenger} dataset, included in \passthrough{\lstinline!R!}, provides monthly totals of
international airline passengers between the years 1949 and 1960.

\textbf{Goal:} we want to forecast the number of airline passengers at time \(h\)
horizon using the historical data from 1949 to 1960.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=R]

\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{05-origami_files/figure-latex/plot_airpass-1} \end{center}

\hypertarget{rolling-origin}{%
\subsubsection{Rolling origin}\label{rolling-origin}}

The rolling origin cross-validation scheme lends itself to ``online'' learning
algorithms, in which large streams of data have to be fit continually
(respecting time), where the fit of the learning algorithm is (constantly)
updated as more data accrues. In general, the rolling origin scheme defines an
initial training set, and, with each iteration, the size of the training set
grows by a batch of \(m\) observations, the size of the validation set remains
constant, there might be a gap between training and validation times of size
\(h\) (a lag window), and new folds are added until time \(t\) is reached in the
validation set. The time points included in the training set always lag behind
behind those in the validation set.

To further illustrate rolling origin cross-validation, we show below an example
that yields three folds. Here, the first window size is fifteen time points, on
which we first train the candidate learning algorithm. We then evaluate its
performance on ten time points with a gap (\(h\)) of five time points between the
training and validation sets.

In the following, we train the learning algorithm on a longer stream of data, 25
time points, including the original fifteen with which we initially started.
Then, we evaluate its performance at a (temporal) distance ten time points
ahead.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{img/png/rolling_origin} 

}

\caption{Rolling origin CV}\label{fig:unnamed-chunk-1}
\end{figure}

We illustrate the usage of the rolling origin cross-validation scheme with
\passthrough{\lstinline!origami!} below, using the \passthrough{\lstinline!folds\_rolling\_origin(n, first\_window, validation\_size, gap, batch)!} function. In order to set up
\passthrough{\lstinline!folds\_rolling\_origin(n, first\_window, validation\_size, gap, batch)!}, we need
the following,

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  the total number of time points we wish to cross-validate (\passthrough{\lstinline!n!});
\item
  the size of the first training set (\passthrough{\lstinline!first\_window!});
\item
  the size of the validation set (\passthrough{\lstinline!validation\_size!});
\item
  the gap between training and validation set(\passthrough{\lstinline!gap!}); and
\item
  the size of the training set update per iteration of cross-validation (\passthrough{\lstinline!batch!}).
\end{enumerate}

Our time-series has \(t=144\) time points. Setting \passthrough{\lstinline!first\_window!} to \(50\),
\passthrough{\lstinline!validation\_size!} to 10, \passthrough{\lstinline!gap!} to 5, and \passthrough{\lstinline!batch!} to 20 yields four time-series
folds; we show the first two below.

\hypertarget{rolling-window}{%
\subsubsection{Rolling window}\label{rolling-window}}

Rather than adding more and more time points to the training set in each
iteration of cross-validation (as under the rolling origin scheme), the rolling
window cross-validation scheme ``rolls'' the training sample forward in time by
\(m\) units (of time). This strategy can be useful, for example, in settings with
parametric learning algorithms, which are often very sensitive to moment (e.g.,
mean, variance) or parameter drift, which is itself challenging to explicitly
account for in the model construction step. The rolling window scheme is also
computationally more efficient, and possibly warranted over rolling origin
when working in streaming data analysis where the training data is too large
for convenient access. In contrast to the
rolling origin scheme, the sampled units in the training set are always the same
for each iteration of the rolling window scheme.

The illustration below depicts rolling window cross-validation using three
time-series folds. The first window size is 15 time points, on which we first
train the candidate learning algorithm. As in the previous illustration, we
evaluate its performance on 10 time points, with a gap of size 5 time points
between the training and validation sets. However, for the next fold, we train
the learning algorithm on time points further away from the origin (here, 10
time points). Note that the size of the training set in the new fold is the same
as in the first fold (both include 15 time points). This setup keeps the
training sets comparable over time (and across folds), unlike under the rolling
origin cross-validation scheme. We then evaluate the performance of the
candidate learning algorithm on 10 time points in the future.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{img/png/rolling_window} 

}

\caption{Rolling window CV}\label{fig:unnamed-chunk-2}
\end{figure}

We demonstrate the usage of the rolling window cross-validation scheme with
\passthrough{\lstinline!origami!} below, using the \passthrough{\lstinline!folds\_rolling\_window(n, window\_size, validation\_size, gap, batch)!} function. In order to set up
\passthrough{\lstinline!folds\_rolling\_window(n, window\_size, validation\_size, gap, batch)!}, we need to
specify the following arguments:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  the total number of time points we wish to cross-validate (\passthrough{\lstinline!n!});
\item
  the size of the training sets (\passthrough{\lstinline!window\_size!});
\item
  the size of the validation set (\passthrough{\lstinline!validation\_size!});
\item
  the gap between training and validation set (\passthrough{\lstinline!gap!}); and
\item
  the size of the training set update per iteration of cross-validation (\passthrough{\lstinline!batch!}).
\end{enumerate}

Setting the \passthrough{\lstinline!window\_size!} to \(50\), \passthrough{\lstinline!validation\_size!} to 10, \passthrough{\lstinline!gap!} to 5 and
\passthrough{\lstinline!batch!} to 20, we also get 4 time-series folds; we show the first two below.

\hypertarget{rolling-origin-with-v-fold}{%
\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Rolling origin with \(V\)-fold}{Rolling origin with V-fold}}\label{rolling-origin-with-v-fold}}

A variant of the rolling origin cross-validation scheme, accounting for sample
dependence, is the rolling-origin-\(V\)-fold cross-validation scheme. In contrast
to the canonical rolling origin scheme, under this hybrid scheme, sampled units
in the training and validation sets are \emph{not} the same, which this scheme
accomplishes by incorporating \(V\)-fold cross-validation within the time-series
setup. Here, the learning algorithm's predictions are evaluated on the future
time points of the time-series observational units excluded from the training
step, accommodating potential dependence not only across time but also across
observational units. To use the rolling-origin-\(V\)-fold cross-validation scheme
with \passthrough{\lstinline!origami!}, we can invoke the \passthrough{\lstinline!folds\_vfold\_rolling\_origin\_pooled(n, t, id, time, V, first\_window, validation\_size, gap, batch)!} function. In the figure
below, we show \(V=2\) folds, alongside two time-series (rolling origin)
cross-validation folds.

\hypertarget{rolling-window-with-v-fold}{%

Just like the scheme described above, the rolling window approach, like the
rolling origin approach, can be extended to support multiple time-series with
arbitrary sample-level dependence by incorporating a \(V\)-fold splitting
component. This rolling-window-\(V\)-fold cross-validation scheme can be used
through \passthrough{\lstinline!origami!} via the \passthrough{\lstinline!folds\_vfold\_rolling\_window\_pooled(n, t, id, time, V, window\_size, validation\_size, gap, batch)!} function. The figure below displays
\(V=2\) folds and two time-series (rolling window) cross-validation folds.

\hypertarget{general-workflow-of-origami}{%
\section{\texorpdfstring{General workflow of \texttt{origami}}{General workflow of origami}}\label{general-workflow-of-origami}}

Before we dive into more details, let's take a moment to review some of the
basic functionality in the \passthrough{\lstinline!origami!} \passthrough{\lstinline!R!} package. The main workhorse function in
\passthrough{\lstinline!origami!} is \passthrough{\lstinline!cross\_validate()!}. To start off, the user must define the fold
structure and a function that operates on each fold (this \passthrough{\lstinline!cv\_fun()!}, in
\passthrough{\lstinline!origami!}'s parlance, usually dictates how the candidate learning algorithm is
trained and its predictions validated).

Once passed to \passthrough{\lstinline!cross\_validate()!}, the workhorse function will iteratively apply
the specified function (i.e., \passthrough{\lstinline!cv\_fun()!}) to each fold, combining the
fold-specific results in a meaningful way. We will see this in action in later
sections --- for now, we provide specific details on each each step of this
process below.

\hypertarget{define-folds}{%
\subsection{(1) Define folds}\label{define-folds}}

The \passthrough{\lstinline!folds!} object passed to \passthrough{\lstinline!cross\_validate!} is a \passthrough{\lstinline!list!} of folds; such \passthrough{\lstinline!list!}
objects are generated using the \passthrough{\lstinline!make\_folds()!} helper function. Each fold
consists of a \passthrough{\lstinline!list!} with a \passthrough{\lstinline!"training"!} index vector, a \passthrough{\lstinline!"validation"!} index
vector, and a \passthrough{\lstinline!"fold\_index"!} (its order in the overall \passthrough{\lstinline!list!} of folds). The
\passthrough{\lstinline!make\_folds()!} function supports a variety of cross-validation schemes,
described in the preceding section. The \passthrough{\lstinline!make\_folds()!} function can also ensure
balance across levels of a given variable (through the \passthrough{\lstinline!strata\_ids!} arguments),
and it can also keep all observations on the same independent unit together (via
the \passthrough{\lstinline!cluster\_ids!} argument).

\hypertarget{define-the-fold-function}{%
\subsection{(2) Define the fold function}\label{define-the-fold-function}}

The \passthrough{\lstinline!cv\_fun!} argument to \passthrough{\lstinline!cross\_validate()!} is a custom function that performs
some operation on each fold (again, \emph{usually} this specifies the training of the
candidate learning algorithm and its evaluation on a given training/validation
split, i.e., in a single fold). The first argument to this function is the
\passthrough{\lstinline!fold!}, which specifies the indices of the units in a given training/validation
split (note that this first argument is automatically passed to the \passthrough{\lstinline!cv\_fun()!}
by \passthrough{\lstinline!cross\_validate()!}, which queries the folds object from \passthrough{\lstinline!make\_folds()!} in
doing so). Additional arguments can be passed to the \passthrough{\lstinline!cv\_fun()!} through the
\passthrough{\lstinline!...!} argument to \passthrough{\lstinline!cross\_validate()!}. Within this function, the convenience
functions \passthrough{\lstinline!training()!}, \passthrough{\lstinline!validation()!} and \passthrough{\lstinline!fold\_index()!} can be used to return
the various components of a fold object. When the \passthrough{\lstinline!training()!} or
\passthrough{\lstinline!validation()!} functions are passed an object of a particular class, they will
index that object in a sensible way. For instance, if the input object is a
vector, these helper functions will index the vector directly, but if the input
object is a \passthrough{\lstinline!data.frame!} or \passthrough{\lstinline!matrix!}, these functions will automatically index
the rows. This allows the user to easily partition data into training and
validation sets. The fold function must return a named \passthrough{\lstinline!list!} of results
containing whatever fold-specific outputs are desired.

\hypertarget{apply-cross_validate}{%
\subsection{\texorpdfstring{(3) Apply \texttt{cross\_validate()}}{(3) Apply cross\_validate()}}\label{apply-cross_validate}}

After defining the folds, the \passthrough{\lstinline!cross\_validate()!} function can be used to map the
\passthrough{\lstinline!cv\_fun()!} across the \passthrough{\lstinline!folds!}; internally, this uses either \passthrough{\lstinline!lapply()!} or
\passthrough{\lstinline!future\_lapply()!} (a parallelized variant of the same). In this way,
\passthrough{\lstinline!cross\_validate()!} can be easily parallelized by specifying a parallelization
scheme (i.e., a \passthrough{\lstinline!plan!} from the \href{https://Cran.R-project.org/package=future}{future parallelization framework for
\passthrough{\lstinline!R!}} \citep{bengtsson2021unifying}). The
application of \passthrough{\lstinline!cross\_validate()!} generates a list of results, matching the
customized \passthrough{\lstinline!list!} specified in the relevant \passthrough{\lstinline!cv\_fun()!}. As noted above, each
call to \passthrough{\lstinline!cv\_fun()!} itself returns a \passthrough{\lstinline!list!} of results, with different named
slots for each type of result we wish to store. The main \passthrough{\lstinline!cross\_validate()!}
loop generates a \passthrough{\lstinline!list!} of these individual, fold-specific \passthrough{\lstinline!list!}s of results (a
\passthrough{\lstinline!list!} of \passthrough{\lstinline!list!}s or ``meta-list''). Internally, this ``meta-list'' is cleaned up
(by concatenation) such that only a single slot per type of result specified by
the \passthrough{\lstinline!cv\_fun()!} is returned (this too is a \passthrough{\lstinline!list!} of the results for each fold).
By default, the \passthrough{\lstinline!combine\_results()!} helper function is used to combine the
individual, fold-specific \passthrough{\lstinline!list!}s of results in a sensible manner. How results
are combined is determined automatically by examining the data types of the
results from the first fold. This can be modified by specifying a \passthrough{\lstinline!list!} of
arguments in the \passthrough{\lstinline!.combine\_control!} argument.

\hypertarget{cross-validation-in-action}{%
\section{Cross-validation in action}\label{cross-validation-in-action}}

We've waited long enough. Now, let's see \passthrough{\lstinline!origami!} in action! In the next
chapter, we will learn how to use cross-validation with the Super Learner
algorithm, and how we can utilize the power of cross-validation to build optimal
ensembles of algorithms --- going far beyond the application of cross-validation
to a single statistical learning method.

\hypertarget{cross-validation-with-linear-regression}{%
\subsection{Cross-validation with linear regression}\label{cross-validation-with-linear-regression}}

First, let's load the relevant \passthrough{\lstinline!R!} packages, set a seed (for reproducibility),
and once again load the WASH Benefits example dataset. For illustrative
purposes, we'll examine the application of cross-validation to simple linear
regression with \passthrough{\lstinline!origami!}, focusing on predicting the weight-for-height Z-score
(\passthrough{\lstinline!whz!}) using all of the other available covariates in the dataset. As mentioned
before, we will assume the dataset contains only independent and identically
distributed units, ignoring the clustering structure imposed by the trial
design. For the sake of illustration, we will work with only a subset of the
data, removing all observational units with missing covariate data from the
analysis-ready dataset. In the prior chapter, we discussed how to deal with
missingness.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=R]
library(stringr)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)

# load data set and take a peek
washb_data <- fread(
  paste0(
    "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tlverse/tlverse-data/master/",
    "wash-benefits/washb_data.csv"
  ),
  stringsAsFactors = TRUE
)

# remove missing data with drop_na(), then pick just the first 500 rows
washb_data <- washb_data %>%
  drop_na() %>%
  slice(1:500)

# specify the outcome and covariates as character vectors
outcome <- "whz"
covars <- colnames(washb_data)[-which(names(washb_data) == outcome)]
\end{lstlisting}

Here's a look at the data:

Let's remind ourselves of the covariates to be used in the prediction step:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=R]

Next, let's fit a simple main-terms linear regression model to the
analysis-ready dataset. Here, our goal is to predict the weight-for-height
Z-score (\passthrough{\lstinline!"whz"!}, which we assigned to the variable \passthrough{\lstinline!outcome!}) using all of the
available covariate data. Let's try it out:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=R]

We can assess the quality of the model fit on the dataset by comparing the
linear model's predictions of the weight-for-height Z-score against the
observations of the same in the dataset. This is the well-known, and standard,
mean squared error (MSE). We can extract this summary measure from the \passthrough{\lstinline!lm!}
model object like so

\begin{lstlisting}[language=R]
(err <- mean(resid(lm_mod)^2))
[1] 0.8657
\end{lstlisting}

The MSE estimate is 0.8657, which, from examination of the above, is merely the
mean of the squared residuals of the model fit. An important problem arises
when we assess the learning algorithm's quality in this way --- that is, because
we have trained our linear regression model on the complete analysis-ready
dataset and then assessed its performance (the MSE) on the same dataset, all of
the data is used for both model training and validation. Unfortunately, this
simple estimate of the MSE is overly optimistic. Why? The linear regression
model is trained on the same dataset used in its evaluation, not unlike reusing
problems from a homework assignment in a course examination. Of course, we are
generally not interested in how well the algorithm explains variation in the
observed dataset; rather, we are interested in how well the explanations
provided by the learning algorithm generalize to a target population from which
this particular sample is drawn. By using all of the data available to us for
training the learning algorithm, we are left unable to honestly evaluate how
well the algorithm fits (and, thus, explains) variation at the level of the
target population.
To resolve this issue, cross-validation allows for a particular procedure (e.g.,
linear regression) to be implemented over training and validation splits of the
dataset, evaluating how well the procedure fits on a holdout (or validation)
set. This evaluation of the learning algorithm's quality on data unseen during
the training phase provides an honest evaluation of the algorithm's
generalization error.

We can easily incorporate cross-validation into our linear regression procedure
using \passthrough{\lstinline!origami!}. First, let's define a new function to perform linear regression
on a specific partition of the dataset (i.e., a fold):

\begin{lstlisting}[language=R]
cv_lm <- function(fold, data, reg_form) {
  # get name and index of outcome variable from regression formula
  out_var <- as.character(unlist(str_split(reg_form, " "))[1])
  out_var_ind <- as.numeric(which(colnames(data) == out_var))

  # split up data into training and validation sets
  train_data <- training(data)
  valid_data <- validation(data)

  # fit linear model on training set and predict on validation set
  mod <- lm(as.formula(reg_form), data = train_data)
  preds <- predict(mod, newdata = valid_data)
  valid_data <- as.data.frame(valid_data)

  # capture results to be returned as output
  out <- list(
    coef = data.frame(t(coef(mod))),
    SE = (preds - valid_data[, out_var_ind])^2
  )
  return(out)
}
\end{lstlisting}

Our \passthrough{\lstinline!cv\_lm()!} function is quite simple: It merely splits the available data into
distinct training and validation sets (using the eponymous functions provided in
\passthrough{\lstinline!origami!}), fits the linear model on the training set, and evaluates the quality
of the trained linear regression model on the validation set. This is a simple
example of what \passthrough{\lstinline!origami!} considers to be a \passthrough{\lstinline!cv\_fun()!} --- functions for applying
a particular routine over an input dataset in cross-validated manner.

Having defined such a function, we can simply generate a set of partitions using
\passthrough{\lstinline!origami!}'s \passthrough{\lstinline!make\_folds()!} function and apply our \passthrough{\lstinline!cv\_lm()!} function over the
resultant \passthrough{\lstinline!folds!} object using \passthrough{\lstinline!cross\_validate()!}. Below, we replicate the
re-substitution estimate of the error --- we did this ``by hand'' above --- using the
functions \passthrough{\lstinline!make\_folds()!} and \passthrough{\lstinline!cv\_lm()!}.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=R]
# re-substitution estimate
resub <- make_folds(washb_data, fold_fun = folds_resubstitution)[[1]]
resub_results <- cv_lm(fold = resub, data = washb_data, reg_form = "whz ~ .")
mean(resub_results$SE, na.rm = TRUE)
[1] 0.8657
\end{lstlisting}

This (nearly) matches the estimate of the error that we obtained above.

We can more honestly evaluate the error by \(V\)-fold cross-validation, which
partitions the dataset into \(V\) subsets, fitting the algorithm on \(V - 1\) of the
subsets (training) and evaluating on the subset that was held out from
fitting (validation). This is repeated such that each holdout subset
takes a turn being used for validation. We can easily apply our \passthrough{\lstinline!cv\_lm()!}
function in this way using \passthrough{\lstinline!origami!}'s \passthrough{\lstinline!cross\_validate()!} (note that by default
this function performs \(10\)-fold cross-validation):

\begin{lstlisting}[language=R]
# cross-validated estimate
folds <- make_folds(washb_data)
cvlm_results <- cross_validate(
  cv_fun = cv_lm, folds = folds, data = washb_data, reg_form = "whz ~ .",
  use_future = FALSE
)
mean(cvlm_results$SE, na.rm = TRUE)
[1] 1.35
\end{lstlisting}

Having performed \(V\)-fold cross-validation with 10 folds (the default), we
quickly notice that our previous
estimate of the model error (by re-substitution) was a bit optimistic. The honest
estimate of the linear regression model's error is larger!

\hypertarget{cross-validation-with-random-forests}{%
\subsection{Cross-validation with random forests}\label{cross-validation-with-random-forests}}

To examine \passthrough{\lstinline!origami!} further, let's return to our example analysis using the
WASH Benefits dataset. Here, we will write a new \passthrough{\lstinline!cv\_fun()!} function. As an
example, we will use Breiman's random forest algorithm \citep{breiman2001random},
implemented in the \passthrough{\lstinline!randomForest()!} function (from the \passthrough{\lstinline!randomForest!} package):

\begin{lstlisting}[language=R]
# make sure to load the package!
library(randomForest)

cv_rf <- function(fold, data, reg_form) {
  # get name and index of outcome variable from regression formula
  out_var <- as.character(unlist(str_split(reg_form, " "))[1])
  out_var_ind <- as.numeric(which(colnames(data) == out_var))

  # define training and validation sets based on input object of class "folds"
  train_data <- training(data)
  valid_data <- validation(data)

  # fit Random Forest regression on training set and predict on holdout set
  mod <- randomForest(formula = as.formula(reg_form), data = train_data)
  preds <- predict(mod, newdata = valid_data)
  valid_data <- as.data.frame(valid_data)

  # define output object to be returned as list (for flexibility)
  out <- list(
    coef = data.frame(mod$coefs),
    SE = ((preds - valid_data[, out_var_ind])^2)
  )
  return(out)
}
\end{lstlisting}

The \passthrough{\lstinline!cv\_rf()!} function, which cross-validates the training and evaluation of the
\passthrough{\lstinline!randomForest!} algorithm, used our previous \passthrough{\lstinline!cv\_lm()!} function as a template.
For now, individual \passthrough{\lstinline!cv\_fun()!}s must be written by hand; however, in future
releases of the package, a wrapper may be made available to support
auto-generating \passthrough{\lstinline!cv\_fun!}s for use with \passthrough{\lstinline!origami!}.

Below, we use \passthrough{\lstinline!cross\_validate()!} to apply our custom \passthrough{\lstinline!cv\_rf()!} function over the
\passthrough{\lstinline!folds!} object generated by \passthrough{\lstinline!make\_folds()!}:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=R]
# now, let's cross-validate...
folds <- make_folds(washb_data)
cvrf_results <- cross_validate(
  cv_fun = cv_rf, folds = folds,
  data = washb_data, reg_form = "whz ~ .",
  use_future = FALSE
)
mean(cvrf_results$SE)
[1] 1.027
\end{lstlisting}

Using \(V\)-fold cross-validation with 10 folds, we obtain an honest estimate of
the prediction error of this random forest. This is one example of how
\passthrough{\lstinline!origami!}'s \passthrough{\lstinline!cross\_validate()!} procedure can be generalized to arbitrary
estimation techniques, as long as an appropriate \passthrough{\lstinline!cv\_fun()!} function is
available.

\hypertarget{cross-validation-with-arima}{%
\subsection{Cross-validation with ARIMA}\label{cross-validation-with-arima}}

Cross-validation can also be used for the selection of forecasting models in
settings with time-series data. Here, the partitioning scheme mirrors the
application of the forecasting model: We'll train the learning algorithm on past
observations (either all available or a recent, in time, subset), and then use
the fitted model to predict the next (again, in time) few observations. To
demonstrate this, we return to the \passthrough{\lstinline!AirPassengers!} dataset, a monthly
time-series of passenger air traffic for thousands of travelers.

Suppose we want to pick between two forecasting models with different ARIMA
(AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model configurations. We can choose
among such models by evaluating their forecasting performance. First, we set up
an appropriate cross-validation scheme for use with time-series data. Here, we
pick the rolling origin cross-validation scheme described above.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=R]
folds <- make_folds(AirPassengers,
  fold_fun = folds_rolling_origin,
  first_window = 36, validation_size = 24, batch = 10

By default, \passthrough{\lstinline!folds\_rolling\_origin!} will increase the size of the training set by
one time point in each training fold. Had we followed the default option, we
would have 85 folds to train! Luckily, we can pass the \passthrough{\lstinline!batch!} as an option to
\passthrough{\lstinline!folds\_rolling\_origin!}, telling it to increase the size of the training set by
10 points in each iteration (so that we don't have so many training folds).
Since we want to forecast the immediately following time point, the \passthrough{\lstinline!gap!}
argument remains at its default of zero.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=R]
# make sure to load the package!

  # First arima model
  arima_fit <- arima(train_ts, c(0, 1, 1),
    seasonal = list(

  arima_pred2 <- 10^raw_arima_pred2$pred
  arima_MSE2 <- mean((arima_pred2 - valid_data)^2)

  out <- list(mse = data.frame(
    fold = fold_index(),
    arima = arima_MSE, arima2 = arima_MSE2
  ))
  return(out)
}

mses <- cross_validate(

  use_future = FALSE

By applying \passthrough{\lstinline!cross\_validate()!} with this \passthrough{\lstinline!cv\_forecasts()!} custom function, we
find that the ARIMA model with no AR (autoregressive) component seems to be a
better fit for this dataset.

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction-3}}

A common task in data analysis is prediction, or using the observed data to
learn a function that takes as input data on covariates/predictors and outputs a
predicted value. Occasionally, the scientific question of interest lends itself
to causal effect estimation. Even in these scenarios, where prediction is not in
the forefront, prediction tasks are embedded in the procedure. For instance, in
targeted minimum loss-based estimation (TMLE) for the average treatment effect,
predictive modeling is necessary for estimating outcome regressions and propensity scores.

There are various strategies that can be employed to model relationships from
data, which we refer to interchangeably as ``estimators'', ``algorithms'', and
``learners''. For some data, algorithms that can pick up on complex relationships
among variables are necessary to adequately model it. For other data, parametric
regression learners might fit the data reasonably well. It is generally
impossible to know in advance which approach will be the best for a given data
set and prediction problem.

The Super Learner (SL) solves the issue of selecting an algorithm, as it can
consider many of them - from the simplest parametric regressions to the most
complex machine learning algorithms (e.g., neural nets, support vector machines,
etc). Additionally, it is proven to perform as well as possible
(as good as the unknown oracle) in large samples, given the learners specified
\citep{vdl2003unified, vdl2004asymptotic, dudoit2005asymptotics, vaart2006oracle}.
The SL represents an entirely pre-specified, flexible, and theoretically
grounded approach for predictive modeling. It has been shown to be adaptive and
robust in a variety of applications, even in very small samples. Detailed
descriptions outlining the SL procedure are widely available \citep{polley2010super, naimi2018stacked}. Practical considerations for specifying the SL, including
how to specify a rich and diverse library of learners, choose a performance
metric for the SL, and specify a cross-validation (CV) scheme, are described in
a pre-print article \citep{rvp2022super}. Here, we focus on introducing \passthrough{\lstinline!sl3!}, the
standard \passthrough{\lstinline!tlverse!} software package for SL.

In this section, the core functionality for fitting any SL with \passthrough{\lstinline!sl3!} is
illustrated. In the sections that follow, additional \passthrough{\lstinline!sl3!} functionality is
presented.

Fitting any SL with \passthrough{\lstinline!sl3!} consists of the following three steps:

\begin{enumerate}

\item
  Define the prediction task with \passthrough{\lstinline!make\_sl3\_Task!}.
\item
  Instantiate the SL with \passthrough{\lstinline!Lrnr\_sl!}.

\subsubsection*{Running example with WASH Benefits dataset}\label{running-example-with-wash-benefits-dataset}}


We will use the WASH Benefits Bangladesh study as an example to guide this
overview of \passthrough{\lstinline!sl3!}. In this study, we are interested in predicting the child
development outcome, weight-for-height z-score, from covariates/predictors,
including socio-economic status variables, gestational age, and maternal
features. More information on this dataset is described in the \href{https://tlverse.org/tlverse-handbook/data.html\#wash}{``Meet the

We will use the \passthrough{\lstinline!fread!} function in the \passthrough{\lstinline!data.table!} R package to load the WASH

To install any package, we recommend first clearing the R workspace and then
restarting the R session. In RStudio, this can be achieved by clicking the
tab ``Session'' then ``Clear Workspace'', and then clicking ``Session'' again then
``Restart R''.

We can install \passthrough{\lstinline!sl3!} using the function \passthrough{\lstinline!install\_github!} provided in the
\passthrough{\lstinline!devtools!} R package. We are using the development (``devel'') version of \passthrough{\lstinline!sl3!}
in these materials, so we show how to install that version below.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=R]

Once the R package is installed, we recommend restarting the R session again.

The \passthrough{\lstinline!sl3\_Task!} object defines the prediction task of interest. Recall that
our task in this illustrative example is to use the WASH Benefits Bangladesh
example dataset to learn a function of the covariates for predicting
weight-for-height Z-score \passthrough{\lstinline!whz!}.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=R]

The \passthrough{\lstinline!sl3\_Task!} keeps track of the roles the variables play in the prediction
problem. Additional information relevant to the prediction task (such as
observational-level weights, offset, id, CV folds) can also be specified in
\passthrough{\lstinline!make\_sl3\_Task!}. The default CV fold structure in \passthrough{\lstinline!sl3!} is V-fold CV (VFCV)
with V=10 folds. If \passthrough{\lstinline!id!} is specified in the task, a clustered V=10 VFCV
scheme is considered; if the outcome type is binary or categorical, then
a stratified V=10 VFCV scheme is considered. Different CV schemes can be
specified by inputting an \passthrough{\lstinline!origami!} folds object, as generated by the
\passthrough{\lstinline!make\_folds!} function in the \passthrough{\lstinline!origami!} R package. For more information,
refer to the previous Chapter on cross-validation, or consult documentation
on \passthrough{\lstinline!origami!}'s \passthrough{\lstinline!make\_folds!} function (e.g., in RStudio, by
loading the \passthrough{\lstinline!origami!} R package and then inputting ``?make\_folds'' in the
Console). For more details on \passthrough{\lstinline!sl3\_Task!}, refer to its documentation (e.g., by
inputting ``?sl3\_Task'' in R).

\emph{Tip:} If you type \passthrough{\lstinline!task$!} and then press the tab key (press tab twice if not in
RStudio), you can view all of the active and public fields, as well as methods that
can be accessed from the \passthrough{\lstinline!task$!} object. This \passthrough{\lstinline!$!} is like the key to access
many internals of an object. In the next section, will see how we can use \passthrough{\lstinline!$!}
to dig into SL fit objects as well - to obtain predictions from an SL fit or
candidate learners, examine an SL fit or its candidates, and summarize an SL
fit.

\subsection*{\texorpdfstring{2. Instantiate the Super Learner with \texttt{Lrnr\_sl}}{2. Instantiate the Super Learner with Lrnr\_sl}}\label{instantiate-the-super-learner-with-lrnr_sl}}


In order to create \passthrough{\lstinline!Lrnr\_sl!} we need to specify, at the minimum, a set of
learners for the SL to consider as candidates. This set of algorithms is
also commonly referred to as the ``library''. We might also specify the
meta-learner, which is the algorithm that ensembles the learners (note that this part is
optional since there are already defaults set up in \passthrough{\lstinline!sl3!}). See ``Practical
considerations for specifying a super learner'' for step-by-step guidelines for
tailoring the SL specification (including the library and meta-learner(s)) that optimizes the prediction task at hand \citep{rvp2022super}.

Learners have properties that indicate what features they support. We may use
the \passthrough{\lstinline!sl3\_list\_properties()!} function to get a list of all properties supported
by at least one learner:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=R]
sl3_list_properties()

Since \passthrough{\lstinline!whz!} is a continuous outcome, we can identify the learners that support
this outcome type with \passthrough{\lstinline!sl3\_list\_learners()!}:

\end{lstlisting}

Now that we have an idea of some learners, let's instantiate a few of them.
Below we instantiate \passthrough{\lstinline!Lrnr\_glm!} and \passthrough{\lstinline!Lrnr\_mean!}, a main terms generalized
linear model (GLM) and a mean model, respectively.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=R]
lrn_glm <- Lrnr_glm$new()
lrn_mean <- Lrnr_mean$new()
\end{lstlisting}

For both of the learners created above, we just used the default tuning
parameters. We can also customize a learner's tuning parameters to incorporate
a diversity of different settings, and consider the same learner with different
tuning parameter specifications.

Below, we consider the same base learner, \passthrough{\lstinline!Lrnr\_glmnet!} (i.e., GLMs
with elastic net regression), and create two different candidates from it:
an L2-penalized/ridge regression and an L1-penalized/lasso regression.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=R]
# penalized regressions:
lrn_ridge <- Lrnr_glmnet$new(alpha = 0)
lrn_lasso <- Lrnr_glmnet$new(alpha = 1)
\end{lstlisting}

By setting \passthrough{\lstinline!alpha!} in \passthrough{\lstinline!Lrnr\_glmnet!} above, we customized this learner's tuning
parameter. When we instantiate \passthrough{\lstinline!Lrnr\_hal9001!} below we show how multiple tuning
parameters (specifically, \passthrough{\lstinline!max\_degree!}and \passthrough{\lstinline!num\_knots!}) can be modified at the
same time.

Let's also instantiate some more learners that do not enforce relationships to
be linear or monotonic, which further diversifies the set of candidates to
include nonparametric learners.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=R]
# spline regressions:
lrn_polspline <- Lrnr_polspline$new()
lrn_earth <- Lrnr_earth$new()

# fast highly adaptive lasso (HAL) implementation
lrn_hal <- Lrnr_hal9001$new(max_degree = 2, num_knots = c(3,2), nfolds = 5)

# tree-based methods
lrn_ranger <- Lrnr_ranger$new()
lrn_xgb <- Lrnr_xgboost$new()
\end{lstlisting}

Let's also include a generalized additive model (GAM) and Bayesian GLM to
further diversify the pool that we will consider as candidates in the SL.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=R]
lrn_gam <- Lrnr_gam$new()
lrn_bayesglm <- Lrnr_bayesglm$new()
\end{lstlisting}

Now that we've instantiated a set of learners, we need to put them together so
the SL can consider them as candidates. In \passthrough{\lstinline!sl3!}, we do this by creating a
so-called \passthrough{\lstinline!Stack!} of learners. A \passthrough{\lstinline!Stack!} is created in the same way we
created the learners. This is because \passthrough{\lstinline!Stack!} is a learner itself; it has the
same interface as all of the other learners. What makes a stack special is that
it considers multiple learners at once: it can train them simultaneously, so
that their predictions can be combined and/or compared.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=R]
stack <- Stack$new(
  lrn_glm, lrn_mean, lrn_ridge, lrn_lasso, lrn_polspline, lrn_earth, lrn_hal, 
  lrn_ranger, lrn_xgb, lrn_gam, lrn_bayesglm
)
stack
 [1] "Lrnr_glm_TRUE"                          
 [2] "Lrnr_mean"                              
 [3] "Lrnr_glmnet_NULL_deviance_10_0_100_TRUE"
 [4] "Lrnr_glmnet_NULL_deviance_10_1_100_TRUE"
 [5] "Lrnr_polspline"                         
 [6] "Lrnr_earth_2_3_backward_0_1_0_0"        
 [7] "Lrnr_hal9001_2_1_c(3, 2)_5"             
 [8] "Lrnr_ranger_500_TRUE_none_1"            
 [9] "Lrnr_xgboost_20_1"                      
[10] "Lrnr_gam_NULL_NULL_GCV.Cp"              
[11] "Lrnr_bayesglm_TRUE"                     
\end{lstlisting}

We can see that the names of the learners in the stack are long. This is
because the default naming of a learner in \passthrough{\lstinline!sl3!} is clunky: for each learner,
every tuning parameter in \passthrough{\lstinline!sl3!} is contained in the name. In the next section,
\href{https://tlverse.org/tlverse-handbook/sl3.html\#naming-learners}{``Naming
Learners''},
we show a few different ways for the user to name learners as they wish.

Now that we have instantiated a set of learners and stacked them together, we
are ready to instantiate the SL. We will use the default meta-learner, which is
non-negative least squares (NNLS) regression (\passthrough{\lstinline!Lrnr\_nnls!}) for continuous
outcomes. For illustrative purposes, we will still go ahead and specify it
in the following.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=R]
sl <- Lrnr_sl$new(learners = stack, metalearner = Lrnr_nnls$new())
\end{lstlisting}

\hypertarget{fit-the-super-learner-to-the-prediction-task-with-train}{%
\subsection*{\texorpdfstring{3. Fit the Super Learner to the prediction task with \texttt{train}}{3. Fit the Super Learner to the prediction task with train}}\label{fit-the-super-learner-to-the-prediction-task-with-train}}


The last step for fitting the SL to the prediction task is to call \passthrough{\lstinline!train!} and
supply the task. Before we call \passthrough{\lstinline!train!}, we will set a random number generator
so the results are reproducible, and we will also time it.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=R]
start_time <- proc.time() # start time

set.seed(4197)
sl_fit <- sl$train(task = task)

runtime_sl_fit <- proc.time() - start_time # end time - start time = run time
runtime_sl_fit
   user  system elapsed 
281.498   6.225 277.831 
\end{lstlisting}

It took 277.8 seconds
(4.6 minutes) to fit the SL.

\hypertarget{summary}{%
\subsubsection*{Summary}\label{summary}}


In this section, the core functionality for fitting any SL with \passthrough{\lstinline!sl3!} was
illustrated. This consists of the following three steps:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Define the prediction task with \passthrough{\lstinline!make\_sl3\_Task!}.
\item
  Instantiate the SL with \passthrough{\lstinline!Lrnr\_sl!}.
\item
  Fit the SL to the task with \passthrough{\lstinline!train!}.
\end{enumerate}

This example was for demonstrative purposes only. See \citet{rvp2022super} for
step-by-step guidelines for constructing a SL that is well-specified for the
prediction task at hand.

\hypertarget{super-learner-and-candidate-learner-predictions}{%
\subsection{Super learner and candidate learner predictions}\label{super-learner-and-candidate-learner-predictions}}

We will draw on the fitted SL object from above, \passthrough{\lstinline!sl\_fit!}, to obtain the
SL's predicted \passthrough{\lstinline!whz!} value for each subject.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=R]
sl_preds <- sl_fit$predict(task = task)
head(sl_preds)
[1] -0.5719 -0.8717 -0.6881 -0.7342 -0.6308 -0.6596
\end{lstlisting}

We can also obtain predicted values from a candidate learner in the SL. Below
we obtain predictions for the GLM learner.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=R]
glm_preds <- sl_fit$learner_fits$Lrnr_glm_TRUE$predict(task = task)
head(glm_preds)
[1] -0.7262 -0.9361 -0.7085 -0.6492 -0.7013 -0.8462
\end{lstlisting}

Note that the predicted values for the SL correspond to so-called ``full fits''
of the candidate learners, in which the candidates are fit to the entire
analytic dataset, i.e., all of the data supplied as \passthrough{\lstinline!data!} to \passthrough{\lstinline!make\_sl3\_Task!}.
Figure 2 in \citet{rvp2022super} provides a visual overview of the SL fitting
procedure.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=R]
# we can also access the candidate learner full fits directly and obtain
# the same "full fit" candidate predictions from there 
# (we split this into two lines to avoid overflow)
stack_full_fits <- sl_fit$fit_object$full_fit$learner_fits$Stack$learner_fits
glm_preds_full_fit <- stack_full_fits$Lrnr_glm_TRUE$predict(task)

# check that they are identical
identical(glm_preds, glm_preds_full_fit)
[1] TRUE
\end{lstlisting}

Below we visualize the observed values for \passthrough{\lstinline!whz!} and predicted \passthrough{\lstinline!whz!} values for
SL, GLM and the mean.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=R]

\hypertarget{predict_fold}{%
\paragraph*{\texorpdfstring{\texttt{predict\_fold}}{predict\_fold}}\label{predict_fold}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{paragraph}{\texttt{predict\_fold}}

Our first option to get CV predictions, \passthrough{\lstinline!cv\_preds\_option1!}, used the
\passthrough{\lstinline!predict\_fold!} function to obtain validation set predictions across all folds.
This function only exists for learner fits that are cross-validated in \passthrough{\lstinline!sl3!},
like those in \passthrough{\lstinline!Lrnr\_sl!}. In addition to supplying \passthrough{\lstinline!fold\_number = "validation"!}
in \passthrough{\lstinline!predict\_fold!}, we can set \passthrough{\lstinline!fold\_number = "full"!} to obtain predictions from
learners fit to the entire analytic dataset (i.e., all of the data supplied to
\passthrough{\lstinline!make\_sl3\_Task!}). For instance, below we show that \passthrough{\lstinline!glm\_preds!} we calculated
above can also be obtained by setting \passthrough{\lstinline!fold\_number = "full"!}.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=R]
full_fit_preds <- sl_fit$fit_object$cv_fit$predict_fold(
  task = task, fold_number = "full"
)
glm_full_fit_preds <- full_fit_preds$Lrnr_glm_TRUE

# check that they are identical
identical(glm_preds, glm_full_fit_preds)
[1] TRUE
\end{lstlisting}

We can also supply a specific integer between 1 and the number of CV folds
to the \passthrough{\lstinline!fold\_number!} argument in \passthrough{\lstinline!predict\_fold!}; example of this
functionality is shown in the next part.

\hypertarget{cross-validated-predictions-by-hand}{%
\paragraph*{Cross-validated predictions by hand}\label{cross-validated-predictions-by-hand}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{paragraph}{Cross-validated predictions by hand}

We can get the CV predictions ``by hand'', by tapping into each of the folds, and
then using the fitted candidate learners (which were trained to the training
set for each fold) to predict validation set outcomes (which were not seen in
training).

\begin{lstlisting}[language=R]
##### CV predictions "by hand" #####
# for each fold, i, we obtain validation set predictions:
cv_preds_list <- lapply(seq_along(task$folds), function(i){
  
  # get validation dataset for fold i:
  v_data <- task$data[task$folds[[i]]$validation_set, ]
  
  # get observed outcomes in fold i's validation dataset:
  v_outcomes <- v_data[["whz"]]

  # make task (for prediction) using fold i's validation dataset as data, 
  # and keeping all else the same:
  v_task <- make_sl3_Task(covariates = task$nodes$covariates, data = v_data)
  
  # get predicted outcomes for fold i's validation dataset, using candidates 
  # trained to fold i's training dataset
  v_preds <- sl_fit$fit_object$cv_fit$predict_fold(
    task = v_task, fold_number = i
  )
  # note: v_preds is a matrix of candidate learner predictions, where the 
  # number of rows is the number of observations in fold i's validation dataset 
  # and the number of columns is the number of candidate learners (excluding 
  # any that might have failed)
  
  # an identical way to get v_preds, which is used when we calculate the 
  # cv risk by hand in a later part of this chapter:
  # v_preds <- sl_fit$fit_object$cv_fit$fit_object$fold_fits[[i]]$predict(
  #   task = v_task
  # )
  
  # we will also return the row indices for fold i's validation set, so we 
  # can later reorder the CV predictions and make sure they are equal to what 
  # we obtained above
  return(list("v_preds" = v_preds, "v_index" = task$folds[[i]]$validation_set))
})

# extract the validation set predictions across all folds
cv_preds_byhand <- do.call(rbind, lapply(cv_preds_list, "[[", "v_preds"))

# extract the indices of validation set observations across all folds
# then reorder cv_preds_byhand to correspond to the ordering in the data
row_index_in_data <- unlist(lapply(cv_preds_list, "[[", "v_index"))
cv_preds_byhand_ordered <- cv_preds_byhand[order(row_index_in_data), ]
# now we can check that they are identical
identical(cv_preds_option1, cv_preds_byhand_ordered)
[1] TRUE
\end{lstlisting}

\hypertarget{predictions-with-new-data}{%
\subsection{Predictions with new data}\label{predictions-with-new-data}}

If we wanted to obtain predicted values for new data then we would need to
create a new \passthrough{\lstinline!sl3\_Task!} from the new data. Also, the covariates in this new
\passthrough{\lstinline!sl3\_Task!} must be identical to the covariates in the \passthrough{\lstinline!sl3\_Task!} for training.
As an example, let's assume we have new covariate data \passthrough{\lstinline!washb\_data\_new!} for
which we want to use the fitted SL to obtain predicted weight-for-height
z-score values.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=R]
# we do not evaluate this code chunk, as `washb_data_new` does not exist
prediction_task <- make_sl3_Task(
  data = washb_data_new, # assuming we have some new data for predictions
  covariates = c("tr", "fracode", "month", "aged", "sex", "momage", "momedu", 
                 "momheight", "hfiacat", "Nlt18", "Ncomp", "watmin", "elec",

                 "asset_mobile")
)
sl_preds_new_task <- sl_fit$predict(task = prediction_task)
\end{lstlisting}

\hypertarget{counterfactual-predictions}{%
\subsection{Counterfactual predictions}\label{counterfactual-predictions}}

Counterfactual predictions are predicted values under an intervention of
interest. Recall from above that we can obtain predicted values for new data by
creating a \passthrough{\lstinline!sl3\_Task!} with the new data whose covariates match the set
considered for training. As an example that draws on the WASH Benefits
Bangladesh study, suppose we would like to obtain predictions for every
subject's weight-for-height z-score (\passthrough{\lstinline!whz!}) outcome under an intervention on
treatment (\passthrough{\lstinline!tr!}) that sets it to the nutrition, water, sanitation, and
handwashing regime.

First we need to create a copy of the dataset, and then we can intervene on
\passthrough{\lstinline!tr!} in the copied dataset, create a new \passthrough{\lstinline!sl3\_Task!} using the copied data and
the same covariates as the training task, and finally obtain predictions
from the fitted SL (which we named \passthrough{\lstinline!sl\_fit!} in the previous section).

\begin{lstlisting}[language=R]
### 1. Copy data
tr_intervention_data <- data.table::copy(washb_data) 

### 2. Define intervention in copied dataset
tr_intervention <- rep("Nutrition + WSH", nrow(washb_data))
# NOTE: When we intervene on a categorical variable (such as "tr"), we need to 
#       define the intervention as a categorical variable (ie a factor).

Note that this type of intervention, where every subject receives the same
intervention, is referred to as ``static''. Interventions that vary depending on
the characteristics of the subject are referred to as ``dynamic''. For instance,
we might consider an intervention that sets the treatment to the desired
(nutrition, water, sanitation, and handwashing) regime if the subject has
a refridgerator, and a nutrition-omitted (water, sanitation, and handwashing)
regime otherwise.

We can see how the meta-learner created a function of the learners in a few
ways. In our illustrative example, we considered the default, NNLS meta-learner
for continuous outcomes. For meta-learners that simply learn a weighted
combination, we can examine their coefficients.

We can also examine the coefficients by directly accessing the meta-learner's
fit object.

Direct access to the meta-learner fit object is also handy for more
complex meta-learners (e.g., non-parametric meta-learners) that are not defined
by a simple set of main terms regression coefficients.

\hypertarget{cross-validated-predictive-performance}{%
\subsection{Cross-validated predictive performance}\label{cross-validated-predictive-performance}}

We can obtain a table of the cross-validated (CV) predictive performance, i.e.,
the CV risk, for each learner included in the SL. Below, we use the
squared error loss for the evaluation function, which equates to the mean
squared error (MSE) as the metric to summarize predictive performance. The
reason why we use the MSE is because it is a valid metric for estimating the
conditional mean, which is what we're learning the prediction function for in
the WASH Benefits example. For more information on selecting an appropriate
performance metric, see \citet{rvp2022super}.

\addcontentsline{toc}{paragraph}{Cross-validated predictive performance by hand}

Similar to how we got the CV predictions ``by hand'', we can also calculate the CV
performance/risk in a way that exposes the procedure. Specifically, this is done
by tapping into each of the folds, and then using the fitted candidate learners
(which were trained to the training set for each fold) to predict validation set
outcomes (which were not seen in training) and then measure the predictive
performance (i.e., risk). Each candidate learner's fold-specific risk is then
averaged across all folds to obtain the CV risk. The function \passthrough{\lstinline!cv\_risk!} does
all of this internally and we show how to do it by hand below, which can be
helpful for understanding the CV risk and how it is calculated.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=R]
##### CV risk "by hand" #####
# for each fold, i, we obtain predictive performance/risk for each candidate:

  v_data <- task$data[task$folds[[i]]$validation_set, ]
  
  # get observed outcomes in fold i's validation dataset:
  v_outcomes <- v_data[["whz"]]

  # make task (for prediction) using fold i's validation dataset as data, 
  # and keeping all else the same:

  v_preds <- sl_fit$fit_object$cv_fit$fit_object$fold_fits[[i]]$predict(v_task)
  # note: v_preds is a matrix of candidate learner predictions, where the 
  # number of rows is the number of observations in fold i's validation dataset 
  # and the number of columns is the number of candidate learners (excluding 
  # any that might have failed)
  
  # calculate predictive performance for fold i for each candidate

\subsection{Cross-validated Super Learner}\label{cross-validated-super-learner}}

We can see from the CV risk table above that the SL is not listed. This is
because we do not have a CV risk for the SL unless we cross-validate it or
include it as a candidate in another SL; the latter is shown in \href{https://tlverse.org/tlverse-handbook/sl3.html\#discrete-super-learner}{the next
subsection}.
Below, we show how to obtain a CV risk estimate for the SL using function
\passthrough{\lstinline!cv\_sl!}. Like before when we called \passthrough{\lstinline!sl$train!}, we will set a random number
generator so the results are reproducible, and we will also time this.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=R]

We can also use so-called ``revere'', to obtain a partial CV risk for the SL,
where the SL candidate learner fits are cross-validated but the meta-learner fit
is not. It takes essentially no extra time to calculate a revere-CV
performance/risk estimate of the SL, since we already have the CV fits of the
candidates. This isn't to say that revere-CV SL performance can replace that
obtained from actual CV SL. Revere can be used to very quickly examine an
approximate lower bound on the SL's CV risk \emph{when the meta-learner is a simple
model}, like NNLS. We can output the revere-based CV risk estimate by setting
\passthrough{\lstinline!get\_sl\_revere\_risk = TRUE!} in \passthrough{\lstinline!cv\_risk!}.

The reason why this is not a fully cross-validated risk estimate is because the
\passthrough{\lstinline!cv\_meta\_fit!} object above (which is the trained meta-learner), was previously
fit to the \emph{entire} matrix of CV predictions from \emph{every} fold (i.e., the
meta-level dataset; see Figure 2 in \citet{rvp2022super} for more detail). This is why
revere-based risks are not a true CV risk. If the meta-learner is not a simple
regression function, and instead a more flexible learner (e.g., random
forest) is used as the meta-learner, then the revere-CV risk estimate of the
resulting SL will be a worse approximation of the CV risk estimate. This is
because more flexible learners are more likely to overfit. When simple
parametric regressions are used as a meta-learner, like what we considered in
our SL (NNLS with \passthrough{\lstinline!Lrnr\_nnls!}), and like all of the default meta-learners in
\passthrough{\lstinline!sl3!}, then the revere-CV risk is a quick way to examine an approximation of
the CV risk estimate of the SL and it can thought of as a ballpark lower bound
on it. This idea holds in our example; that is, with the simple NNLS
meta-learner the revere risk estimate of the SL (1.0033)
is very close to, and slightly lower than, the CV risk estimate for the SL
(1.0067).

\hypertarget{discrete-super-learner}{%
\section{Discrete Super Learner}\label{discrete-super-learner}}

From the glossary (Table 1) entry for discrete SL (dSL) in \citet{rvp2022super},
the dSL is ``a SL that uses a winner-take-all meta-learner called
the cross-validated selector. The dSL is therefore identical to the candidate
with the best cross-validated performance; its predictions will be the same as
this candidate's predictions''. The cross-validated selector is
\passthrough{\lstinline!Lrnr\_cv\_selector!} in \passthrough{\lstinline!sl3!} (see \passthrough{\lstinline!Lrnr\_cv\_selector!} documentation for more
detail) and a dSL is instantiated in \passthrough{\lstinline!sl3!} by using \passthrough{\lstinline!Lrnr\_cv\_selector!} as the
meta-learner in \passthrough{\lstinline!Lrnr\_sl!}.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=R]
cv_selector <- Lrnr_cv_selector$new(eval_function = loss_squared_error)
dSL <- Lrnr_sl$new(learners = stack, metalearner = cv_selector)
\end{lstlisting}

Just like before, we use the learner's \passthrough{\lstinline!train!} method to fit it to the
prediction task.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=R]
set.seed(4197)
dSL_fit <- dSL$train(task)
\end{lstlisting}

Following from subsection \href{https://tlverse.org/tlverse-handbook/sl3.html\#summarizing-super-learner-fits}{``Summarizing Super Learner
Fits''}
above, we can see how the \passthrough{\lstinline!Lrnr\_cv\_selector!} meta-learner created a function of
the candidates.

                                      0 
\end{lstlisting}

We can also examine the CV risk of the candidates alongside the coefficients:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=R]
dSL_cv_risk_table <- dSL_fit$cv_risk(eval_fun = loss_squared_error)
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=R]

\end{lstlisting}

\end{tabular}

The multivariate adaptive splines regression candidate (\passthrough{\lstinline!Lrnr\_earth!}) has the
lowest CV risk. Indeed, our winner-take-all meta-learner \passthrough{\lstinline!Lrnr\_cv\_selector!}
gave it a weight of one and all others zero weight; the resulting dSL will be
defined by this weighted combination, i.e., \passthrough{\lstinline!dSL\_fit!} will be identical to the
full fit \passthrough{\lstinline!Lrnr\_earth!}. We verify that the \passthrough{\lstinline!dSL\_fit!}'s predictions are identical
to \passthrough{\lstinline!Lrnr\_earth!}'s below.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=R]
dSL_pred <- dSL_fit$predict(task)

\subsection{Including ensemble Super Learner(s) as candidate(s) in discrete Super Learner}\label{including-ensemble-super-learners-as-candidates-in-discrete-super-learner}}

We recommend using CV to evaluate the predictive performance of the SL. We
showed how to do this with \passthrough{\lstinline!cv\_sl!} above. We have also seen that when we
include a learner as a candidate in the SL (in \passthrough{\lstinline!sl3!} terms, when we include a
learner in the \passthrough{\lstinline!Stack!} passed to \passthrough{\lstinline!Lrnr\_sl!} as \passthrough{\lstinline!learners!}), we are able to
examine its CV risk. Also, when we use the dSL, the candidate that achieved the
lowest CV risk defines the resulting SL. We therefore can use the dSL automate
a procedure for obtaining a final SL that represents the candidate with the
best cross-validated predictive performance. When the ensemble SL (eSL) and
its candidate learners are considered in a dSL as candidates, the eSL's CV
performance can be compared to that from the learners from which it was
constructed, and the final SL will be the candidate that achieved the lowest CV
risk. From the glossary (Table 1) entry for eSL in \citet{rvp2022super}, an
eSL is ``a SL that uses any parametric or non-parametric algorithm as its
meta-learner. Therefore, the eSL is defined by a combination of multiple
candidates; its predictions are defined by a combination of multiple candidates'
predictions.'' In the following, we show how to include the eSL, and multiple
eSLs, as candidates in the dSL.

Recall the SL object, \passthrough{\lstinline!sl!}, defined in section 2:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=R]
# in the section 2 we defined Lrnr_sl as
# sl <- Lrnr_sl$new(learners = stack, metalearner = Lrnr_nnls$new())
\end{lstlisting}

\passthrough{\lstinline!sl!} is an eSL since it used NNLS as the meta-learner. We rename \passthrough{\lstinline!sl!} to
\passthrough{\lstinline!eSL\_metaNNLS!} below to clarify that this is an eSL that uses NNLS as its
meta-learner. Note that the candidate learners in this eSL are those passed
to the \passthrough{\lstinline!learners!} argument, i.e., \passthrough{\lstinline!stack!}.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=R]
# let's rename it to clarify that this is an eSL that uses NNLS as meta-learner
eSL_metaNNLS <- sl
\end{lstlisting}

To consider the \passthrough{\lstinline!eSL\_metaNNLS!} as an additional candidate in \passthrough{\lstinline!stack!}, we can
create a new stack that includes the original candidate learners and the eSL.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=R]
stack_with_eSL <- Stack$new(stack, eSL_metaNNLS)
\end{lstlisting}

To instantiate the dSL that considers as its candidates \passthrough{\lstinline!eSL\_metaNNLS!} and the
individual learners from which \passthrough{\lstinline!eSL\_metaNNLS!} was constructed, we define
a new \passthrough{\lstinline!Lrnr\_sl!} that considers \passthrough{\lstinline!stack\_with\_eSL!} as candidates and
\passthrough{\lstinline!Lrnr\_cv\_selector!} as the meta-learner.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=R]
cv_selector <- Lrnr_cv_selector$new(eval_function = loss_squared_error)
dSL <- Lrnr_sl$new(learners = stack_with_eSL, metalearner = cv_selector)
\end{lstlisting}

When we include an eSL as a candidate in the dSL, this allows the eSL's CV
performance to be compared to that from the other learners from which it was
constructed. This is similar to calling CV SL, \passthrough{\lstinline!cv\_sl!}, above. The difference
between including the eSL as a candidate in the dSL and calling \passthrough{\lstinline!cv\_sl!} is that
the former automates a procedure for the final SL to be the learner that
achieved the best CV predictive performance, i.e., lowest CV risk. If the eSL
outperforms any other candidate, the dSL will end up selecting it and the
resulting SL will be the eSL. As mentioned in \citet{rvp2022super}, ``another advantage
of this approach is that multiple eSLs that use more flexible meta-learner
methods (e.g., non-parametric machine learning algorithms like HAL) can be
evaluated simultaneously.''

Below, we show how multiple eSLs can be included as candidates in a dSL:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=R]
# instantiate more eSLs
eSL_metaNNLSconvex <- Lrnr_sl$new(
  learners = stack, metalearner = Lrnr_nnls$new(convex = TRUE)
)
eSL_metaLasso <- Lrnr_sl$new(learners = stack, metalearner = lrn_lasso)
eSL_metaEarth <- Lrnr_sl$new(learners = stack, metalearner = lrn_earth)
eSL_metaRanger <- Lrnr_sl$new(learners = stack, metalearner = lrn_ranger)
eSL_metaHAL <- Lrnr_sl$new(learners = stack, metalearner = lrn_hal)
# adding the eSLs to the stack that defined them
stack_with_eSLs <- Stack$new(
  stack, eSL_metaNNLS, eSL_metaNNLSconvex, eSL_metaLasso, eSL_metaEarth, 
  eSL_metaRanger, eSL_metaHAL
)
# specify dSL
dSL <- Lrnr_sl$new(learners = stack_with_eSLs, metalearner = cv_selector)
\end{lstlisting}

We included as candidates in the dSL:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  the same eSL as before, \passthrough{\lstinline!eSL\_metaNNLS!};
\item
  the learners considered as candidates in (1);
\item
  an eSL that considered the same candidate learners as (1) and a convex
  combination-constrained NNLS as the meta-learner;
\item
  an eSL that considered the same candidate learners as (1) and a lasso
  meta-learner, using \passthrough{\lstinline!lrn\_lasso!} which was instantiated in section 2;
\item
  an eSL that considered the same candidate learners as (1) and a
  multivariate adaptive regression splines (earth) meta-learner, using
  \passthrough{\lstinline!lrn\_earth!} which was instantiated in section 2;
\item
  an eSL that considered the same candidate learners as (1) and a
  ranger meta-learner, using \passthrough{\lstinline!lrn\_ranger!} which was instantiated in section 2; and
\item
  an eSL that considered the same candidate learners as (1) and a
  HAL meta-learner, using \passthrough{\lstinline!lrn\_hal!} which was instantiated in section 2.
\end{enumerate}

Running this many eSLs in the dSL is currently very computationally intensive
in \passthrough{\lstinline!sl3!}, as it is akin to running cross-validated SL for each eSL. Parallel
programming (reviewed below) is recommended for training learners that are
computationally intensive, like the \passthrough{\lstinline!dSL!} defined above. That is, a parallel
processing scheme should be defined before calling \passthrough{\lstinline!dSL$train(task)!} in order
to speed up the run time.

\hypertarget{parallel-processing}{%
\section{Parallel Processing}\label{parallel-processing}}

It's straightforward to take advantage of \passthrough{\lstinline!sl3!}'s built-in parallel processing
support, which draws on the \href{https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/future/index.html}{\passthrough{\lstinline!future!} R
package}, which
provides a lightweight, unified Future API for sequential and parallel
processing of R expressions via futures. From the \passthrough{\lstinline!future!} package
documentation: ``This package implements sequential, multicore, multisession, and cluster futures. With these, R expressions can be evaluated on the local
machine, in parallel a set of local machines, or distributed on a mix of local
and remote machines. Extensions to this package implement additional backends
for processing futures via compute cluster schedulers, etc. Because of its
unified API, there is no need to modify any code in order switch from
sequential on the local machine to, say, distributed processing on a remote
compute cluster. Another strength of this package is that global variables and
functions are automatically identified and exported as needed, making it
straightforward to tweak existing code to make use of futures.''

To use \passthrough{\lstinline!future!} with \passthrough{\lstinline!sl3!}, you can simply choose a futures \passthrough{\lstinline!plan()!}, as shown
below.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=R]
# let's load the future package and set n-1 cores for parallel processing
library(future)
ncores <- availableCores()-1
ncores

plan(multicore, workers = ncores)
# now, let's re-train sl in parallel for demonstrative purposes
# we will also set a stopwatch so we can see how long this takes
start_time <- proc.time()

set.seed(4197)
sl_fit_parallel <- sl$train(task)

runtime_sl_fit_parallel <- proc.time() - start_time

\hypertarget{default-data-pre-processing}{%
\section{Default Data Pre-processing}\label{default-data-pre-processing}}

In \passthrough{\lstinline!sl3!} it is required that the analytic dataset (i.e., the dataset
consisting of observations on an outcome and covariates) does not contain any
missing values, and it does not contain character and factor covariates.
In this subsection, we review the default functionality in \passthrough{\lstinline!sl3!} that takes care
of this internally; specifically, this data pre-processing occurs when
\passthrough{\lstinline!make\_sl3\_Task!} is called.

Users can also perform any pre-processing before creating the \passthrough{\lstinline!sl3\_Task!}
(as needed) to bypass the default functionality discussed in the following.
See \citet{rvp2022super}, section ``Preliminaries: Analytic dataset pre-processing''
for more information and general guidelines to follow for pre-processing of the
analytic dataset, including considerations for pre-processing in high
dimensional settings.

Recall that the \passthrough{\lstinline!sl3\_Task!} object defines the prediction task of interest. Our
task in the illustrative example from above was to use the WASH Benefits
Bangladesh data to learn a function of the covariates for predicting
weight-for-height Z-score \passthrough{\lstinline!whz!}. For more details on \passthrough{\lstinline!sl3\_Task!}, refer to the
documentation (e.g., by inputting ``?sl3\_Task'' in R). We will instantiate the
task in order to examine the pre-processing of \passthrough{\lstinline!washb\_data!}.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=R]
# create the task (i.e., use washb_data to predict outcome using covariates)
task <- make_sl3_Task(
  data = washb_data,
  outcome = "whz",
  covariates = c("tr", "fracode", "month", "aged", "sex", "momage", "momedu", 
                 "momheight", "hfiacat", "Nlt18", "Ncomp", "watmin", "elec", 
                 "floor", "walls", "roof", "asset_wardrobe", "asset_table", 
                 "asset_chair", "asset_khat", "asset_chouki", "asset_tv", 
                 "asset_refrig", "asset_bike", "asset_moto", "asset_sewmach", 
                 "asset_mobile")
)

\end{lstlisting}

\hypertarget{imputation-and-missingness-indicators}{%
\subsection{Imputation and missingness indicators}\label{imputation-and-missingness-indicators}}

Notice the warning that appeared when we created the task above. (We muted this
warning when we created the task in the previous section). This warning states
that missing covariate data was detected and imputed. For each covariate column
with missing values, \passthrough{\lstinline!sl3!} uses the median to impute missing continuous
covariates, and the mode to impute discrete (binary and categorical) covariates.

Also, for each covariate with missing values, an additional column indicating
whether the value was imputed is incorporated. The so-called ``missingness
indicator'' covariates can be helpful, as the pattern of covariate missingness
might be informative for predicting the outcome.

Users are free to handle missingness in their covariate data before creating
the sl3 task. In any case, we do recommend the inclusion of the
missingness indicator as a covariate. Let's examine this in greater detail for
completeness. It's also easier to see what's going on here by examining it with
an example.

First, let's examine the missingness in the data:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=R]
# which columns have missing values, and how many observations are missing?
colSums(is.na(washb_data))
           whz             tr        fracode          month           aged 
             0              0              0              0              0 
           sex         momage         momedu      momheight        hfiacat 
             0             18              0             31              0 
         Nlt18          Ncomp         watmin           elec          floor 
             0              0              0              0              0 
         walls           roof asset_wardrobe    asset_table    asset_chair 
             0              0              0              0              0

             0              0              0              0              0 
    asset_moto  asset_sewmach   asset_mobile 
             0              0              0 
\end{lstlisting}

We can see that covariates \passthrough{\lstinline!momage!} and \passthrough{\lstinline!momheight!} have missing observations.
Let's check out a few rows in the data with missing values:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=R]
some_rows_with_missingness <- which(!complete.cases(washb_data))[31:33]
# note: we chose 31:33 because missingness in momage & momheight is there
washb_data[some_rows_with_missingness, c("momage", "momheight")]
   momage momheight
1:     NA     153.2
2:     17        NA
3:     23        NA
\end{lstlisting}

When we called \passthrough{\lstinline!make\_sl3\_Task!} using \passthrough{\lstinline!washb\_data!} with missing covariate values,
\passthrough{\lstinline!momage!} and \passthrough{\lstinline!momheight!} were imputed with their respective medians (since they
are continuous), and a missingness indicator (denoted by prefix ``delta\_'') was
added for each of them. See below:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=R]
task$data[some_rows_with_missingness,
          c("momage", "momheight", "delta_momage", "delta_momheight")]
   momage momheight delta_momage delta_momheight

           roof  asset_wardrobe     asset_table     asset_chair      asset_khat 
              0               0               0               0               0

  asset_sewmach    asset_mobile    delta_momage delta_momheight             whz 
              0               0               0               0               0 
\end{lstlisting}

Indeed, we can see that \passthrough{\lstinline!washb\_task$data!} has no missing values. The missingness
indicators take a value of 0 when the observation \emph{was not} in the original data
and a value of 1 when the observation \emph{was} in the original data.

If the data supplied to \passthrough{\lstinline!make\_sl3\_Task!} contains missing outcome values, then an
error will be thrown. Missing outcomes in the data can easily be dropped when
the task is created, by setting \passthrough{\lstinline!drop\_missing\_outcome = TRUE!}. In general, we do
not recommend dropping missing outcomes during data pre-processing, unless the
problem of interest is purely prediction. This is because complete case analyses
are generally biased; it is typically unrealistic to assume the missingness is
completely random and therefore unsafe to just drop the observations with
missing outcomes. For instance, in the estimation of estimands that admit
Targeted Minimum Loss-based Estimators (i.e., pathwise differentiable estimands,
including most parameters arising in causal inference that do not violate
positivity, and those reviewed in the following chapters), the missingness that
should be reflected in the expression of the question of interest (e.g., what
would have been the average effect of treatment with Drug A compared to standard
of care under no loss to follow-up) is also incorporated in the estimation
procedure. That is, the probability of loss to follow-up is a prediction
function that is approximated (e.g., with SL) and incorporated that in the
estimation of the target parameter and the inference / uncertainty
quantification.

\hypertarget{character-and-categorical-covariates}{%
\subsection{Character and categorical covariates}\label{character-and-categorical-covariates}}

First any character covariates are converted to factors. Then all factor
covariates are one-hot encoded, i.e., the levels of a factor become a set of
binary indicators. For example, the factor \passthrough{\lstinline!cats!} and it's one-hot encoding are
shown below:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=R]
cats <- c("calico", "tabby", "cow", "ragdoll", "mancoon", "dwarf", "calico")
cats <- factor(cats)
cats_onehot <- factor_to_indicators(cats)
cats_onehot
     cow dwarf mancoon ragdoll tabby
[1,]   0     0       0       0     0
[2,]   0     0       0       0     1
[3,]   1     0       0       0     0
[4,]   0     0       0       1     0
[5,]   0     0       1       0     0
[6,]   0     1       0       0     0
[7,]   0     0       0       0     0
\end{lstlisting}

The second value for \passthrough{\lstinline!cats!} was ``tabby'' so the second row of \passthrough{\lstinline!cats\_onehot!} has
value 1 under tabby. Every level of \passthrough{\lstinline!cats!} except for one is represented in the
\passthrough{\lstinline!cats\_onehot!} table. The first and last \passthrough{\lstinline!cats!} are ``calico'' so the first and
last rows of \passthrough{\lstinline!cats\_onehot!} are zero across all columns, to denote this level
that does not appear explicitly in the table.

The learners in \passthrough{\lstinline!sl3!} are trained to the object \passthrough{\lstinline!X!} in the task, or a sample of
\passthrough{\lstinline!X!} for learners that use CV. Let's check out the first six rows of our task's
\passthrough{\lstinline!X!} object:

We can see that any character columns in the WASH Benefits dataset were
converted to factors and all factors (\passthrough{\lstinline!tr!}, \passthrough{\lstinline!momedu!}, \passthrough{\lstinline!hfiacat!} and \passthrough{\lstinline!fracode!})
were one-hot encoded. We can also see that the missingness indicators reviewed
above are the last two columns in \passthrough{\lstinline!task$X!}: \passthrough{\lstinline!delta\_momage!} and \passthrough{\lstinline!delta\_momage!}.
The imputed \passthrough{\lstinline!momage!} and \passthrough{\lstinline!momheight!} are also in the task's \passthrough{\lstinline!X!} object.

\hypertarget{learner-documentation}{%
\section{Learner Documentation}\label{learner-documentation}}

Documentation for the learners and some of their tuning parameters can be found
in the R session (e.g., to see \passthrough{\lstinline!Lrnr\_glmnet!}'s parameters, one could type
``?Lrnr\_glmnet'' in RStudio's R console) or online at the \href{https://tlverse.org/sl3/reference/index.html\#section-sl-learners}{\passthrough{\lstinline!sl3!} Learners
Reference}.
All of the learners in \passthrough{\lstinline!sl3!} are simply wrappers around existing functions from
other software packages in R. For example, \passthrough{\lstinline!sl3!}'s \passthrough{\lstinline!Lrnr\_xgboost!} is a learner
in \passthrough{\lstinline!sl3!} for fitting the XGBoost (eXtreme Gradient Boosting) algorithm. As
described in the \passthrough{\lstinline!Lrnr\_xgboost!} documentation, ``this learner provides fitting
procedures for \passthrough{\lstinline!xgboost!} models, using the \passthrough{\lstinline!xgboost!} package, via \passthrough{\lstinline!xgb.train!}''.
In general, the documentation in \passthrough{\lstinline!sl3!} for a learner refers the reader to the
original function and package that \passthrough{\lstinline!sl3!} has wrapped a learner around. With
that in mind, the \passthrough{\lstinline!sl3!} learner documentation is a good first place to look up
any learner, as it will show us exactly which package and function the learner
is based on. However, any thorough investigation of a learner (such as a
detailed explanation of all tuning parameters or how it models the data)
typically involves referencing the original package. Continuing the
example from above, this means that, while some information will be provided in
\passthrough{\lstinline!Lrnr\_xgboost!} documentation, such as learning that \passthrough{\lstinline!Lrnr\_xgboost!} uses the
\passthrough{\lstinline!xgboost!} package's \passthrough{\lstinline!xgb.train!} function, the deepest understanding of the
XGBoost algorithm available in \passthrough{\lstinline!sl3!} will come from referencing the \passthrough{\lstinline!xgboost!}
R package and its \passthrough{\lstinline!xgb.train!} function.

\hypertarget{naming-learners}{%
\section{Naming Learners}\label{naming-learners}}

Recall that our \passthrough{\lstinline!Stack!} from the example above had long names.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=R]
stack
 [1] "Lrnr_glm_TRUE"                          
 [2] "Lrnr_mean"                              
 [3] "Lrnr_glmnet_NULL_deviance_10_0_100_TRUE"
 [4] "Lrnr_glmnet_NULL_deviance_10_1_100_TRUE"
 [5] "Lrnr_polspline"                         
 [6] "Lrnr_earth_2_3_backward_0_1_0_0"        
 [7] "Lrnr_hal9001_2_1_c(3, 2)_5"             
 [8] "Lrnr_ranger_500_TRUE_none_1"            
 [9] "Lrnr_xgboost_20_1"                      
[10] "Lrnr_gam_NULL_NULL_GCV.Cp"              
[11] "Lrnr_bayesglm_TRUE"                     
\end{lstlisting}

Here, we show a few different ways for the user to name learners. The first way
to name a learner is upon instantiation, as shown below:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=R]
lrn_glm <- Lrnr_glm$new(name = "GLM")
\end{lstlisting}

We can specify the \passthrough{\lstinline!name!} for any learner upon instantiating it. Above,
we named the GLM learner ``GLM''.

Also, we can specify the names of the learners upon creation of the \passthrough{\lstinline!Stack!}:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=R]
learners_pretty_names <- c(
  "GLM" = lrn_glm, "Mean" = lrn_mean, "Ridge" = lrn_ridge, 
  "Lasso" = lrn_lasso, "Polspline" = lrn_polspline, "Earth" = lrn_earth, 
  "HAL" = lrn_hal, "RF" = lrn_ranger, "XGBoost" = lrn_xgb, "GAM" = lrn_gam, 
  "BayesGLM" = lrn_bayesglm
)
stack_pretty_names <- Stack$new(learners_pretty_names)
stack_pretty_names
 [1] "GLM"       "Mean"      "Ridge"     "Lasso"     "Polspline" "Earth"    
 [7] "HAL"       "RF"        "XGBoost"   "GAM"       "BayesGLM" 
\end{lstlisting}

\hypertarget{defining-learners-over-grid-of-tuning-parameters}{%
\section{Defining Learners over Grid of Tuning Parameters}\label{defining-learners-over-grid-of-tuning-parameters}}

Customized learners can be created over a grid of tuning parameters. For
highly flexible learners that require careful tuning, it is oftentimes
very helpful to consider different tuning parameter specifications. However,
this is time consuming, so computational feasibility should be considered.
Also, when the effective sample size is small, highly flexible learners
will likely not perform well since they typically require a lot of data to fit
their models. See \citet{rvp2022super} for information on the effective sample size,
and step-by-step guidelines for tailoring the SL specification to perform well
for the prediction task at hand.

We show two ways to customize learners over a grid of tuning parameters. The
first, ``do-it-yourself'' approach requires that the user or a collaborator has
knowledge of the algorithm and their tuning parameters, so they can adequately
specify a set of tuning parameters themselves. The second approach does not
require the user to have specialized knowledge of an algorithm (although some
understanding is still helpful); it uses the \passthrough{\lstinline!caret!} software to automatically
select an ``optimal'' set of tuning parameters over a grid of them.

\hypertarget{do-it-yourself-grid}{%
\subsection{Do-it-yourself grid}\label{do-it-yourself-grid}}

Below, we show how we can create several variations of an XGBoost learner,
\passthrough{\lstinline!Lrnr\_xgboost!}, by hand. This example is just for demonstrative purposes; users
should consult the documentation, and consider computational feasibility and
their prediction task to specify an appropriate grid of tuning parameters for
their task.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=R]
grid_params <- list(
  max_depth = c(3, 5, 8),
  eta = c(0.001, 0.1, 0.3),
  nrounds = 100
)
grid <- expand.grid(grid_params, KEEP.OUT.ATTRS = FALSE)

xgb_learners <- apply(grid, MARGIN = 1, function(tuning_params) {
  do.call(Lrnr_xgboost$new, as.list(tuning_params))
})
xgb_learners
[[1]]
[1] "Lrnr_xgboost_100_1_3_0.001"

[[2]]
[1] "Lrnr_xgboost_100_1_5_0.001"

[[3]]
[1] "Lrnr_xgboost_100_1_8_0.001"

[[4]]
[1] "Lrnr_xgboost_100_1_3_0.1"

[[5]]
[1] "Lrnr_xgboost_100_1_5_0.1"

[[6]]
[1] "Lrnr_xgboost_100_1_8_0.1"

[[7]]
[1] "Lrnr_xgboost_100_1_3_0.3"

[[8]]
[1] "Lrnr_xgboost_100_1_5_0.3"

[[9]]
[1] "Lrnr_xgboost_100_1_8_0.3"
\end{lstlisting}

In the example above, we considered every possible combination in the grid to
create nine XGBoost learners. If we wanted to create custom names for each of
these learners we could do that as well:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=R]
names(xgb_learners) <- c(
  "XGBoost_depth3_eta.001", "XGBoost_depth5_eta.001", "XGBoost_depth8_eta.001", 
  "XGBoost_depth3_eta.1", "XGBoost_depth5_eta.1", "XGBoost_depth8_eta.1", 
  "XGBoost_depth3_eta.3", "XGBoost_depth5_eta.3", "XGBoost_depth8_eta.3"
)
\end{lstlisting}

\hypertarget{automatic-grid-and-selection-with-caret}{%
\subsection{\texorpdfstring{Automatic grid and selection with \texttt{caret}}{Automatic grid and selection with caret}}\label{automatic-grid-and-selection-with-caret}}

We can use the \passthrough{\lstinline!Lrnr\_caret!} to use the \passthrough{\lstinline!caret!} software. As described in the
\passthrough{\lstinline!Lrnr\_caret!} documentation, \passthrough{\lstinline!Lrnr\_caret!} ``uses the \passthrough{\lstinline!caret!} package's \passthrough{\lstinline!train!}
function to automatically tune a predictive model''. Below, we instantiate a
neural network that will be automatically tuned with \passthrough{\lstinline!caret!} and we name the
learner ``NNET\_autotune''.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=R]
lrnr_nnet_autotune <- Lrnr_caret$new(method = "nnet", name = "NNET_autotune")
\end{lstlisting}

\hypertarget{learners-with-interactions-and-formula-interface}{%
\section{\texorpdfstring{Learners with Interactions and \texttt{formula} Interface}{Learners with Interactions and formula Interface}}\label{learners-with-interactions-and-formula-interface}}

As described in in \citet{rvp2022super}, if it's known/possible that there are
interactions among covariates then we can include learners that pick up on that
explicitly (e.g., by including in the library a parametric regression learner
with interactions specified in a formula) or implicitly (e.g., by including in
the library tree-based algorithms that learn interactions empirically).

One way to define interaction terms among covariates in \passthrough{\lstinline!sl3!} is with a
\passthrough{\lstinline!formula!}. The argument exists in \passthrough{\lstinline!Lrnr\_base!}, which is inherited by every
learner in \passthrough{\lstinline!sl3!}; even though \passthrough{\lstinline!formula!} does not explicitly appear as a
learner argument, it is via this inheritance. This implementation allows
\passthrough{\lstinline!formula!} to be supplied to all learners, even those without native \passthrough{\lstinline!formula!}
support. Below, we show how to specify a GLM learner that considers two-way
interactions among all covariates.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=R]
lrnr_glm_interaction <- Lrnr_glm$new(formula = "~.^2")
\end{lstlisting}

As we can see from above, the general behavior of \passthrough{\lstinline!formula!}in R applies in
\passthrough{\lstinline!sl3!}. See Details of \passthrough{\lstinline!formula!} in the \passthrough{\lstinline!stats!} R package for more details on
this syntax (e.g,. in RStudio, type ``?formula'' in the Console and information
will appear in the Help tab).

\hypertarget{covariate-screening}{%
\section{Covariate Screening}\label{covariate-screening}}

One characteristic of a rich library of learners is that it is effective at
handling covariates of high dimension. When there are many covariates in the
data relative to the effective sample size (see Figure 1 Flowchart in
\citet{rvp2022super}), candidate learners should be coupled with a range of so-called
``screeners''. A screener is simply a function that returns a subset of
covariates. A screener is intended to be coupled with a candidate learner, to
define a new candidate learner that considers the reduced set of
screener-returned covariates as its covariates.

As stated in \citet{rvp2022super}, ``covariate screening is essential when the
dimensionality of the data is very large, and it can be practically useful in
any SL or machine learning application. Screening of covariates that considers
associations with the outcome must be cross validated to avoid biasing the
estimate of an algorithm's predictive performance''. By including
screener-learner couplings as additional candidates in the SL library, we are
cross validating the screening of covariates. Covariates retained in each CV
fold may vary.

A ``range of screeners'' is a set of screeners that exhibits varying
degrees of dimension reduction and incorporates different fitting procedures
(e.g., lasso-based screeners that retain covariates with non-zero
coefficients, and importance-based screeners that retain the top \(j\) most
important covariates according to some importance metric. The current set of
screeners available in \passthrough{\lstinline!sl3!} is described in each part below.

We will see that, to define a screener and learner coupling in \passthrough{\lstinline!sl3!},
we need to create a \passthrough{\lstinline!Pipeline!}. A \passthrough{\lstinline!Pipeline!} is a set of learners
to be fit sequentially, where the fit from one learner is used to define the
task for the next learner.

\hypertarget{variable-importance-based-screeners}{%
\subsection{Variable importance-based screeners}\label{variable-importance-based-screeners}}

Variable importance-based screeners retain the top \(j\) most important covariates
according to some importance metric. This screener is provided by
\passthrough{\lstinline!Lrnr\_screener\_importance!} in \passthrough{\lstinline!sl3!} and the parameter \(j\) (default is five) is
provided by the user via the \passthrough{\lstinline!num\_screen!} argument. The user also gets to
choose the importance metric considered via the \passthrough{\lstinline!learner!} argument. Any
learner with an importance method can be used in \passthrough{\lstinline!Lrnr\_screener\_importance!};
this currently includes the following:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=R]
sl3_list_learners(properties = "importance")
[1] "Lrnr_lightgbm"     "Lrnr_randomForest" "Lrnr_ranger"      
[4] "Lrnr_xgboost"     
\end{lstlisting}

Let's consider screening covariates based on \passthrough{\lstinline!Lrnr\_ranger!} variable importance
ranking that selects the top ten most important covariates, according to
\passthrough{\lstinline!ranger!}'s ``impurity\_corrected'' importance. We will couple this screener with
\passthrough{\lstinline!Lrnr\_glm!} to define a new learner that (1) selects the top ten most important
covariates, according to \passthrough{\lstinline!ranger!}'s ``impurity\_corrected'' importance, and then
(2) passes the screener-selected covariates to \passthrough{\lstinline!Lrnr\_glm!}, so \passthrough{\lstinline!Lrnr\_glm!}
fits a model according to this reduced set of covariates. As mentioned above,
this coupling establishes a new learner and requires defining a \passthrough{\lstinline!Pipeline!}.
The \passthrough{\lstinline!Pipeline!} is \passthrough{\lstinline!sl3!}'s way of going from (1) to (2).

\begin{lstlisting}[language=R]
ranger_with_importance <- Lrnr_ranger$new(importance = "impurity_corrected")
RFscreen_top10 <- Lrnr_screener_importance$new(
  learner = ranger_with_importance, num_screen = 10
)
RFscreen_top10_glm <- Pipeline$new(RFscreen_top10, lrn_glm)
\end{lstlisting}

We could even define the \passthrough{\lstinline!Pipeline!} for the entire \passthrough{\lstinline!Stack!}, so that every
learner in it is fit to the screener-selected, reduced set of ten covariates.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=R]
RFscreen_top10_stack <- Pipeline$new(RFscreen_top10, stack)
\end{lstlisting}

\hypertarget{coefficient-threshold-based-screeners}{%
\subsection{Coefficient threshold-based screeners}\label{coefficient-threshold-based-screeners}}

\passthrough{\lstinline!Lrnr\_screener\_coefs!} provides screening of covariates based on the magnitude
of their estimated coefficients in a (possibly regularized) GLM. The
\passthrough{\lstinline!threshold!} (default = 1e-3) defines the minimum absolute size of the
coefficients, and thus covariates, to be kept. Also, a \passthrough{\lstinline!max\_retain!} argument
can be optionally provided to restrict the number of selected covariates to be
no more than \passthrough{\lstinline!max\_retain!}.

Let's consider screening covariates with \passthrough{\lstinline!Lrnr\_screener\_coefs!} to select the
variables with non-zero lasso regression coefficients. We will couple this
screener with \passthrough{\lstinline!Lrnr\_glm!} to define a new learner that (1) selects the covariates
with non-zero lasso regression coefficients, and then (2) passes the
screener-selected covariates to \passthrough{\lstinline!Lrnr\_glm!}, so \passthrough{\lstinline!Lrnr\_glm!} fits a model
according to this reduced set of covariates. The structure is very similar to
above.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=R]
lasso_screen <- Lrnr_screener_coefs$new(learner = lrn_lasso, threshold = 0)
lasso_screen_glm <- Pipeline$new(lasso_screen, lrn_glm)
\end{lstlisting}

We could even define the \passthrough{\lstinline!Pipeline!} for the entire \passthrough{\lstinline!Stack!}, so that every
learner in it is fit to the lasso screener-selected, reduced set of covariates.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=R]
lasso_screen_stack <- Pipeline$new(lasso_screen, stack)
\end{lstlisting}

\hypertarget{correlation-based-screeners}{%
\subsection{Correlation-based screeners}\label{correlation-based-screeners}}

\passthrough{\lstinline!Lrnr\_screener\_correlation!} provides covariate screening procedures by
running a test of correlation (Pearson default), and then selecting the (1) top
ranked variables (default), or (2) the variables with a p-value lower than
some user-specified threshold.

Let's consider screening covariates with \passthrough{\lstinline!Lrnr\_screener\_coefs!}. We will
illustrate how to set up a pipeline with a \passthrough{\lstinline!Stack!}, which looks the same as
previous examples. The \passthrough{\lstinline!Pipeline!} with a single learner also looks the same as
previous examples.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=R]
# select top 10 most correlated covariates
corRank_screen <- Lrnr_screener_correlation$new(
  type = "rank", num_screen = 10
)
corRank_screen_stack <- Pipeline$new(corRank_screen, stack)

# select covariates with correlation p-value below 0.05, and a minimum of 3
corP_screen <- Lrnr_screener_correlation$new(
  type = "threshold", pvalue_threshold = 0.05, min_screen = 3
)
corP_screen_stack <- Pipeline$new(corP_screen, stack)
\end{lstlisting}

\hypertarget{augmented-screeners}{%
\subsection{Augmented screeners}\label{augmented-screeners}}

Augmented screeners are special in that they enforce certain covariates to
always be included. That is, if a screener removes a ``mandatory'' covariate then
\passthrough{\lstinline!Lrnr\_screener\_augment!} will reincorporate it before the learner(s) in the
\passthrough{\lstinline!Pipeline!} are fit. An example of how to use this screener is included below.
We assume \passthrough{\lstinline!aged!} and \passthrough{\lstinline!momage!} are covariates that must be kept in learner
fitting.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=R]
keepme <- c("aged", "momage")
# using corRank_screen as an example, but any instantiated screener can be 
# supplied as screener.
corRank_screen_augmented <- Lrnr_screener_augment$new(
  screener = corRank_screen, default_covariates = keepme
)
corRank_screen_augmented_glm <- Pipeline$new(corRank_screen_augmented, lrn_glm)
\end{lstlisting}

\passthrough{\lstinline!Lrnr\_screener\_augment!} is useful when subject-matter experts feel strongly
that certain covariate sets must be included, even under screening procedures.

\hypertarget{stack-with-range-of-screeners}{%
\subsection{\texorpdfstring{\texttt{Stack} with range of screeners}{Stack with range of screeners}}\label{stack-with-range-of-screeners}}

Above, we mentioned that we'd like to consider a range of screeners to
diversify the library. Here we show how we can create a new \passthrough{\lstinline!Stack!} from other
learners stacks which includes learners with no screening, and learners coupled
with various screeners.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=R]
screeners_stack <- Stack$new(stack, corP_screen_stack, corRank_screen_stack, 
                             lasso_screen_stack, RFscreen_top10_stack)
\end{lstlisting}

This \passthrough{\lstinline!screeners\_stack!} could be inputted as \passthrough{\lstinline!learners!} in \passthrough{\lstinline!Lrnr\_sl!} to
define the SL that considers as candidates learners with no screening, and
learners coupled with various screeners.

\hypertarget{variable-importance-measures}{%
\section{Variable Importance Measures}\label{variable-importance-measures}}

Variable importance can be interesting and informative. It can also be
contradictory and confusing. Nevertheless, our collaborators tend to like it,
so we created a function to assess variable importance in \passthrough{\lstinline!sl3!}. The \passthrough{\lstinline!sl3!}
\passthrough{\lstinline!importance!} function returns a table with variables listed in decreasing order
of importance (i.e., most important listed on the first row).

The measure of importance in \passthrough{\lstinline!sl3!} is based on a ratio or difference of
predictive performance between the SL fit with a removed or permuted
covariate (or covariate grouping), and the SL fit with the observed covariate (or
covariate grouping), across all of them. In this manner, the larger the
ratio/difference in predictive performance, the more important the covariate
(or covariate group) is in the SL prediction.

The intuition of this measure is that it calculates the predictive risk (e.g.,
MSE) of losing one covariate (or one group of covariates), while keeping
everything else fixed, comparing this predictive risk to the one from the
analytic dataset. If the ratio in predictive risks is one, or the difference is
zero, then losing that covariate (group) had no impact, and it is thus not
important according to this measure. This procedure is repeated across all of
the covariates/groups. As stated above, we can remove each covariate (or
covariate group) and refit the SL without it, or we just permute it (faster) and
hope for this shuffling to distort any meaningful information that was present.
This idea of permuting instead of removing saves a lot of time, and is also
incorporated in \passthrough{\lstinline!randomForest!} variable importance measures. However, the
permutation approach is more risky. The \passthrough{\lstinline!sl3!} \passthrough{\lstinline!importance!} default is to remove
each covariate and then refit. Below, we use the \passthrough{\lstinline!permute!} approach because it
is so much faster.

Let's explore the \passthrough{\lstinline!sl3!} variable importance measurements for \passthrough{\lstinline!sl\_fit!}, the
SL we fit above to the WASH Benefits example dataset. We define a grouping
of covariates to consider in the importance evaluation that is based on
household assets, as this collection of variables reflects the socio-economic
status (SES) of the study's participants.

\hypertarget{conditional-density-estimation}{%
\section{Conditional Density Estimation}\label{conditional-density-estimation}}

In certain scenarios it may be useful to estimate the conditional density of a
dependent variable, given predictors/covariates that precede it. In the context
of causal inference, this arises most readily when working with
continuous-valued treatments. Specifically, conditional density estimation (CDE)
is necessary when estimating the treatment mechanism for a continuous-valued
treatment, often called the \emph{generalized propensity score}. Compared the
classical propensity score (PS) for binary treatments (the conditional
probability of receiving the treatment given covariates), \(\mathbb{P}(A = 1 \mid W)\), the generalized PS is the conditional density of treatment \(A\), given
covariates \(W\), \(\mathbb{P}(A \mid W)\).

CDE often requires specialized approaches tied to very specific algorithmic
implementations. To our knowledge, general and flexible algorithms for CDE have
been proposed only sparsely in the literature. We have implemented two such
approaches in \passthrough{\lstinline!sl3!}: a semiparametric CDE approach that makes certain
assumptions about the constancy of (higher) moments of the underlying
distribution, and second approach that exploits the relationship between the
conditional hazard and density functions to allow CDE via pooled hazard
regression. Both approaches are flexible in that they allow the use of arbitrary
regression functions or machine learning algorithms for the estimation of
nuisance quantities (the conditional mean or the conditional hazard,
respectively). We elaborate on these two frameworks below. Importantly, per
\citet{dudoit2005asymptotics} and related works, a loss function appropriate for
density estimation is the negative log-density loss \(L(\cdot) = -\log(p_n(\cdot))\).

\hypertarget{moment-restricted-location-scale}{%
\subsection{Moment-restricted location-scale}\label{moment-restricted-location-scale}}

This family of semiparametric CDE approaches exploits the general form \(\rho(Y - \mu(X) / \sigma(X))\), where \(Y\) is the dependent variable of interest (e.g.,
treatment \(A\) in the PS), \(X\) are the predictors (e.g., covariates \(W\) in the
PS), \(\rho\) is a specified marginal density function, and \(\mu(X) = \E(Y \mid X)\) and \(\sigma(X) = \E[(Y - \mu(X))^2 \mid X]\) are nuisance functions of the
dependent variable that may be estimated flexibly. CDE procedures formulated
within this framework may be characterized as belonging to a \emph{conditional
location-scale} family, that is, in which \(p_n(Y \mid X) = \rho((Y - \mu_n(X)) / \sigma_n(X))\). While CDE with conditional location-scale families is not without
potential disadvantages (e.g., the restriction on the density's functional form
could lead to misspecification bias), this strategy is flexible in that it
allows for arbitrary machine learning algorithms to be used in estimating the
conditional mean of \(Y\) given \(X\), \(\mu(X) = \E(Y \mid X)\), and the conditional
variance of \(Y\) given \(X\), \(\sigma(X) = \E[(Y - \mu(X))^2 \mid X]\).

In settings with limited data, the additional structure imposed by the
assumption that the target density belongs to a location-scale family may prove
advantageous by smoothing over areas of low support in the data. However, in
practice, it is impossible to know whether and when this assumption holds. This
procedure is not a novel contribution of our own (and we have been unable to
locate a formal description of it in the literature); nevertheless, we provide
an informal algorithm sketch below. This algorithm considers access to \(n\)
independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) copies of an observed data
random variable \(O = (Y, X)\), an \emph{a priori}-specified kernel function \(\rho\), a
candidate regression procedure \(f_{\mu}\) to estimate \(\mu(X)\), and a candidate
regression procedure \(f_{\sigma}\) to estimate \(\sigma(X)\).

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Estimate \(\mu(X) = \E[Y \mid X]\), the conditional mean of \(Y\) given \(X\), by
  applying the regression estimator \(f_{\mu}\), yielding \(\hat{\mu}(X)\).
\item
  Estimate \(\sigma(X) = \mathbb{V}[Y \mid X]\), the conditional variance of \(Y\)
  given \(X\), by applying the regression estimator \(f_{\sigma}\), yielding
  \(\hat{\sigma}^2(X)\). Note that this step involves only estimation of the
  conditional mean \(\E[(Y - \hat{\mu}(X))^2 \mid X]\).
\item
  Estimate the one-dimensional density of \((Y - \hat{\mu}(X))^2 / \hat{\sigma}^2(X)\), using kernel smoothing to obtain \(\hat{\rho}(Y)\).
\item
  Construct the estimated conditional density \(p_n(Y \mid X) = \hat{\rho}((Y - \hat{\mu}(X)) / \hat{\sigma}(X))\).
\end{enumerate}

This algorithm sketch encompasses two forms of this CDE approach, which diverge
at the second step above. To simplify the approach, one may elect to estimate
only the conditional mean \(\mu(X)\), leaving the conditional variance to be
assumed constant (i.e., estimated simply as the marginal mean of the residuals
\(\E[(Y - \hat{\mu}(X))^2]\)). This subclass of CDE approaches have \emph{homoscedastic
error} based on the variance assumption made. The conditional variance can
instead by estimated as the conditional mean of the residuals \((Y - \hat{\mu}(X))^2\) given \(X\), \(\E[(Y - \hat{\mu}(X))^2 \mid X]\), where the
candidate algorithm \(f_{\sigma}\) is used to evaluate the expectation. Both
approaches have been implemented in \passthrough{\lstinline!sl3!}, in the learner
\passthrough{\lstinline!Lrnr\_density\_semiparametric!}. The \passthrough{\lstinline!mean\_learner!} argument specifies \(f_{\mu}\)
and the optional \passthrough{\lstinline!var\_learner!} argument specifies \(f_{\sigma}\). We demonstrate
CDE with this approach below.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=R]
# semiparametric density estimator with homoscedastic errors (HOSE)
hose_hal_lrnr <- Lrnr_density_semiparametric$new(
  mean_learner = Lrnr_hal9001$new()

  mean_learner = Lrnr_ranger$new()
  var_learner = Lrnr_glm$new()
)

# SL for the conditional treatment density

  learners = list(hose_hal_lrnr, hese_rf_glm_lrnr),
  metalearner = Lrnr_solnp_density$new()
)
\end{lstlisting}

\hypertarget{pooled-hazard-regression}{%
\subsection{Pooled hazard regression}\label{pooled-hazard-regression}}

Another approach for CDE available in \passthrough{\lstinline!sl3!}, and originally proposed in
\citet{diaz2011super}, leverages the relationship between the (conditional) hazard and
density functions. To develop their CDE framework, \citet{diaz2011super} proposed
discretizing a continuous dependent variable \(Y\) with support \(\mathcal{Y}\)
based on a number of bins \(T\) and a binning procedure (e.g., cutting
\(\mathcal{Y}\) into \(T\) bins of exactly the same length). The tuning parameter
\(T\) conceptually corresponds to the choice of bandwidth in classical kernel
density estimation. Following discretization, each unit is represented by a
collection of records, and the number of records representing a given unit
depends on the rank of the bin (along the discretized support) into which the
unit falls.

To take an example, an instantiation of this procedure might divide the support
of \(Y\) into, say, \(T = 4\), bins of equal length (note this requires \(T+1\) cut
points): \([\alpha_1, \alpha_2), [\alpha_2, \alpha_3), [\alpha_3, \alpha_4), [\alpha_4, \alpha_5]\) (n.b., the rightmost interval is fully closed while the
others are only partially closed). Next, an artificial, repeated measures
dataset would be created in which each unit would be represented by up to \(T\)
records. To better see this structure, consider an individual unit \(O_i = (Y_i, X_i)\) whose \(Y_i\) value is within \([\alpha_3, \alpha_4)\), the third bin. This
unit would be represented by three distinct records: \(\{Y_{ij}, X_{ij}\}_{j=1}^3\), where \(\{\{Y_{ij} = 0\}_{j=1}^2\), \(Y_{i3} = 1\}\) and three
exact copies of \(X_i\), \(\{X_{ij}\}_{j=1}^3\). This representation in terms of
multiple records for the same unit allows for the conditional hazard probability
of \(Y_i\) falling in a given bin along the discretized support to be evaluated
via standard binary regression techniques.

In fact, this proposal reformulates the binary regression problem into a
corresponding set of hazard regressions: \(\mathbb{P} (Y \in [\alpha_{t-1}, \alpha_t) \mid X) = \mathbb{P} (Y \in [\alpha_{t-1}, \alpha_t) \mid Y \geq \alpha_{t-1}, X) \times \prod_{j = 1}^{t -1} \{1 - \mathbb{P} (Y \in [\alpha_{j-1}, \alpha_j) \mid Y \geq \alpha_{j-1}, X) \}\). Here, the probability
of \(Y \in \mathcal{Y}\) falling in bin \([\alpha_{t-1}, \alpha_t)\) may be directly
estimated via a binary regression procedure, by re-expressing the corresponding
likelihood in terms of the likelihood of a binary variable in a dataset with
this repeated measures structure. Finally, the hazard estimates can be mapped into
density estimates by re-scaling the hazard estimates by the bin sizes \(\lvert \alpha_t - \alpha_{t-1} \rvert\), that is, \(p_{n, \alpha}(Y \mid X) = \mathbb{P}(Y \in [\alpha_{t-1}, \alpha_t) \mid X) / \lvert \alpha_t - \alpha_{t-1} \rvert\), for \(\alpha_{t-1} \leq a < \alpha_t\). We provide an
informal sketch of this algorithm below.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Apply a procedure to divide the observed support of \(Y\), \(\max(Y) - \min(Y)\),
  into \(T\) bins: \([\alpha_1, \alpha_2), \ldots, [\alpha_{t-1}, \alpha_t), [\alpha_t, \alpha_{t+1}]\).
\item
  Expand the observed data into a repeated measures data structure, expressing
  each individual observation as a set of up to \(T\) records, recording the
  observation ID alongside each such record. For a single unit \(i\), the set of
  records takes the form \(\{Y_{ij}, X_{ij}\}_{j=1}^{T_i}\), where \(X_{ij}\) are
  constant in the index set \(\mathcal{J}\), \(Y_{ij}\) is a binary counting
  process that jumps from \(0\) to \(1\) at its final index (at the bin into which
  \(Y_i\) falls), and \(T_i \leq T\) indicates the bin along its support into which
  \(Y_i\) falls.
\item
  Estimate the hazard probability, conditional on \(X\), of bin membership
  \(\mathbb{P}(Y_i \in [\alpha_{t-1}, \alpha_t) \mid X)\) using any binary
  regression estimator or appropriate machine learning algorithm.
\item
  Rescale the conditional hazard probability estimates to the conditional
  density scale by dividing the cumulative hazard by the width of the bin into
  which \(X_i\) falls, for each observation \(i = 1, \ldots, n\). If the support
  set is partitioned into bins of equal size (approximately \(n/T\) samples in
  each bin), this amounts to rescaling by a constant. If the support set is
  partitioned into bins of equal range, then the rescaling might vary across
  bins.
\end{enumerate}

A key element of this proposal is the flexibility to use any binary regression
procedure or appropriate machine learning algorithm to estimate \(\mathbb{P}(Y \in [\alpha_{t-1}, \alpha_t) \mid X)\), facilitating the incorporation of
flexibletechniques like ensemble learning \citep{breiman1996stacked, vdl2007super}.
This extreme degree of flexibility integrates perfectly with the underlying
design principles of \passthrough{\lstinline!sl3!}; however, we have not yet implemented this approach
in its full generality. A version of this CDE approach, which limits the
original proposal by replacing the use of arbitrary binary regression with the
highly adaptive lasso (HAL) algorithm \citep{benkeser2016hal} is supported in the
\href{https://github.com/nhejazi/haldensify}{\passthrough{\lstinline!haldensify!} package}
\citep{hejazi2020haldensify} (the HAL implementation in \passthrough{\lstinline!haldensify!} is provided the
\href{https://github.com\%20tlverse/hal9001}{\passthrough{\lstinline!hal9001!} package} \citep{coyle2020hal9001, hejazi2020hal9001}). This CDE algorithm that uses \passthrough{\lstinline!haldensify!} is incorporated
as learner \passthrough{\lstinline!Lrnr\_haldensify!} in \passthrough{\lstinline!sl3!}, as we demonstrate below.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=R]

  n_bins = c(5, 10)

\section{Concluding Remarks}\label{concluding-remarks}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Super Learner (SL) is a general approach that can be applied to a diversity of
  estimation and prediction problems which can be defined by a loss function.
\item
  It would be straightforward to plug in the estimator returned by SL into the
  target parameter mapping.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    For example, suppose we are after the average treatment effect (ATE) of a
    binary treatment intervention:
    \(\Psi_0 = E_{0,W}[E_0(Y|A=1,W) - E_0(Y|A=0,W)]\).
  \item
    We could use the SL that was trained on the original data (let's call
    this \passthrough{\lstinline!sl\_fit!}) to predict the outcome for all subjects under each
    intervention. All we would need to do is take the average difference
    between the counterfactual outcomes under each intervention of interest.
  \item
    Considering \(\Psi_0\) above, we would first need two \(n\)-length vectors of
    predicted outcomes under each intervention. One vector would represent
    the predicted outcomes under an intervention that sets all subjects to
    receive \(A=1\), \(Y_i|A_i=1,W_i\) for all \(i=1,\ldots,n\). The other vector
    would represent the predicted outcomes under an intervention that sets
    all subjects to receive \(A=0\), \(Y_i|A_i=0,W_i\) for all \(i=1,\ldots,n\).
  \item
    After obtaining these vectors of counterfactual predicted outcomes, all
    we would need to do is average and then take the difference in order to
    ``plug-in'' the SL estimator into the target parameter mapping.
  \item
    In \passthrough{\lstinline!sl3!} and with our current ATE example, this could be achieved with
    \passthrough{\lstinline!mean(sl\_fit$predict(A1\_task)) - mean(sl\_fit$predict(A0\_task))!};
    where \passthrough{\lstinline!A1\_task$data!} would contain all 1's (or the level that pertains to
    receiving the treatment) for the treatment column in the data (keeping
    all else the same), and \passthrough{\lstinline!A0\_task$data!} would contain all 0's (or the
    level that pertains to not receiving the treatment) for the treatment
    column in the data.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  It's a worthwhile exercise to obtain the predicted counterfactual outcomes
  and create these counterfactual \passthrough{\lstinline!sl3!} tasks. It's too biased, however, to
  plug the SL fit into the target parameter mapping, (e.g., calling the result
  of \passthrough{\lstinline!mean(sl\_fit$predict(A1\_task)) - mean(sl\_fit$predict(A0\_task))!} the
  estimated ATE. We would end up with an estimator for the ATE that was
  optimized for estimation of the prediction function, and not the ATE!
\item
  Ultimately, we want an estimator that is does the best job in approximating
  our question of interest. That is, we care about doing a the best job
  possible estimating \(\psi_0\). The SL is an essential step to help us get
  there: the counterfactual predicted outcome estimates (like those
  explained above), and other SL-derived estimates (like a propensity score)
  play a key role in estimating \(\psi_0\). However, SL is not the end of the
  estimation procedure. Specifically, if we simply plugged in the SL estimates
  into the target parameter, we would not have an asymptotically linear
  estimator of the target estimand; the SL is not an efficient substitution
  estimator and does not admit statistical inference. Why does this matter?

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    An asymptotically linear estimator is one that converges to the estimand a
    \(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}\) rate, thereby permitting formal statistical inference,
    i.e., confidence intervals and \(p\)-values, (see Chapters 4--6 of
    \citet{vdl2011targeted}).
  \item
    Substitution, or plug-in, estimators are desirable because they respect
    both the local and global constraints of the statistical model, such as
    bounds on an outcome, and have they have better finite-sample properties
    (see Chapter 6 of \citet{vdl2011targeted}).
  \item
    An efficient estimator is optimal in the sense that it has the lowest
    possible variance, and is thus the most precise. An estimator is efficient
    if and only if is asymptotically linear with influence curve equal to the
    canonical gradient (see Chapter 6 of \citet{vdl2011targeted}).

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      The canonical gradient is a mathematical object that is specific to
      the target estimand, and it provides information on the level of
      difficulty of the estimation problem (Chapter 5 of \citet{vdl2011targeted}).
      Various canonical gradients are shown in the chapters that follow.
    \item
      Practitioners do not need to know how to calculate a canonical
      gradient to explain properties that are desirable for an
      estimator to possess (like substitution/plug-in, admits valid inference,
      efficient, and ability to optimize finite sample performance).
      These properties motivate the use TMLE, since TMLE satisfies them.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  TMLE is a general strategy that succeeds in constructing efficient and
  asymptotically linear plug-in estimators that are robust in finite samples.
\item
  SL is fantastic for pure prediction, and for obtaining initial
  estimates of components in the likelihood (the first step of TMLE), but we
  need the second, targeting/updating/fluctuation, step to have the desirable
  statistical properties mentioned above.
\item
  In the chapters that follow, we focus on various targeted maximum likelihood
  estimator and the targeted minimum loss-based estimator, both referred to as
  TMLE.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{tmle-intro}{%
\section{Introduction}\label{tmle-intro}}

In the previous chapter on \passthrough{\lstinline!sl3!} we learned how to estimate a regression
function like \(\mathbb{E}[Y \mid X]\) from data. That's an important first step
in learning from data, but how can we use this predictive model to estimate
statistical and causal effects?

Going back to \protect\hyperlink{roadmap}{the roadmap for targeted learning}, suppose we'd like to
estimate the effect of a treatment variable \(A\) on an outcome \(Y\). As discussed,
one potential parameter that characterizes that effect is the Average Treatment
Effect (ATE), defined as \(\psi_0 = \mathbb{E}_W[\mathbb{E}[Y \mid A=1,W] - \mathbb{E}[Y \mid A=0,W]]\) and interpreted as the difference in mean outcome
under when treatment \(A=1\) and \(A=0\), averaging over the distribution of
covariates \(W\). We'll illustrate several potential estimators for this
parameter, and motivate the use of the TMLE (targeted maximum likelihood
estimation; targeted minimum loss-based estimation) framework, using the
following example data:

\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{img/png/schematic_1_truedgd} \end{center}

The small ticks on the right indicate the mean outcomes (averaging over \(W\))
under \(A=1\) and \(A=0\) respectively, so their difference is the quantity we'd
like to estimate.

While we hope to motivate the application of TMLE in this chapter, we refer the
interested reader to the two Targeted Learning books and associated works for
full technical details.

\hypertarget{substitution-est}{%
\section{Substitution Estimators}\label{substitution-est}}

We can use \passthrough{\lstinline!sl3!} to fit a Super Learner or other regression model to estimate
the outcome regression function \(\mathbb{E}_0[Y \mid A,W]\), which we often refer
to as \(\overline{Q}_0(A,W)\) and whose estimate we denote \(\overline{Q}_n(A,W)\).
To construct an estimate of the ATE \(\psi_n\), we need only ``plug-in'' the
estimates of \(\overline{Q}_n(A,W)\), evaluated at the two intervention contrasts,
to the corresponding ATE ``plug-in'' formula:
\(\psi_n = \frac{1}{n}\sum(\overline{Q}_n(1,W)-\overline{Q}_n(0,W))\). This kind
of estimator is called a \emph{plug-in} or \emph{substitution} estimator, since accurate
estimates \(\psi_n\) of the parameter \(\psi_0\) may be obtained by substituting
estimates \(\overline{Q}_n(A,W)\) for the relevant regression functions
\(\overline{Q}_0(A,W)\) themselves.

Applying \passthrough{\lstinline!sl3!} to estimate the outcome regression in our example, we can see
that the ensemble machine learning predictions fit the data quite well:

\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{img/png/schematic_2b_sllik} \end{center}

The solid lines indicate the \passthrough{\lstinline!sl3!} estimate of the regression function, with the
dotted lines indicating the \passthrough{\lstinline!tmle3!} updates \protect\hyperlink{tmle-updates}{(described below)}.

While substitution estimators are intuitive, naively using this approach with a
Super Learner estimate of \(\overline{Q}_0(A,W)\) has several limitations. First,
Super Learner is selecting learner weights to minimize risk across the entire
regression function, instead of ``targeting'' the ATE parameter we hope to
estimate, leading to biased estimation. That is, \passthrough{\lstinline!sl3!} is trying to do well on
the full regression curve on the left, instead of focusing on the small ticks on
the right. What's more, the sampling distribution of this approach is not
asymptotically linear, and therefore inference is not possible.

We can see these limitations illustrated in the estimates generated for the
example data:

\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{img/png/schematic_3_effects} \end{center}

We see that Super Learner, estimates the true parameter value (indicated by the
dashed vertical line) more accurately than GLM. However, it is still less
accurate than TMLE, and valid inference is not possible. In contrast, TMLE
achieves a less biased estimator and valid inference.

\hypertarget{tmle}{%
\section{Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimation}\label{tmle}}

TMLE takes an initial estimate \(\overline{Q}_n(A,W)\) as well as an estimate of
the propensity score \(g_n(A \mid W) = \mathbb{P}(A = 1 \mid W)\) and produces an
updated estimate \(\overline{Q}^{\star}_n(A,W)\) that is ``targeted'' to the
parameter of interest. TMLE keeps the benefits of substitution estimators (it is
one), but augments the original, potentially erratic estimates to \emph{correct for
bias} while also resulting in an \emph{asymptotically linear} (and thus normally
distributed) estimator that accommodates inference via asymptotically consistent
Wald-style confidence intervals.

\hypertarget{tmle-updates}{%
\subsection{TMLE Updates}\label{tmle-updates}}

There are different types of TMLEs (and, sometimes, multiple for the same set of
target parameters) -- below, we give an example of the algorithm for TML
estimation of the ATE. \(\overline{Q}^{\star}_n(A,W)\) is the TMLE-augmented
estimate \(f(\overline{Q}^{\star}_n(A,W)) = f(\overline{Q}_n(A,W)) + \epsilon \cdot H_n(A,W)\), where \(f(\cdot)\) is the appropriate link function (e.g.,
\(\text{logit}(x) = \log(x / (1 - x))\)), and an estimate \(\epsilon_n\) of the
coefficient \(\epsilon\) of the ``clever covariate'' \(H_n(A,W)\) is computed. The
form of the covariate \(H_n(A,W)\) differs across target parameters; in this case
of the ATE, it is \(H_n(A,W) = \frac{A}{g_n(A \mid W)} - \frac{1-A}{1-g_n(A, W)}\), with \(g_n(A,W) = \mathbb{P}(A=1 \mid W)\) being the estimated propensity
score, so the estimator depends both on the initial fit (by \passthrough{\lstinline!sl3!}) of the
outcome regression (\(\overline{Q}_n\)) and of the propensity score (\(g_n\)).

There are several robust augmentations that are used across the \passthrough{\lstinline!tlverse!},
including the use of an additional layer of cross-validation to avoid
over-fitting bias (i.e., CV-TMLE) as well as approaches for more consistently
estimating several parameters simultaneously (e.g., the points on a survival
curve).

\hypertarget{tmle-infer}{%
\subsection{Statistical Inference}\label{tmle-infer}}

Since TMLE yields an \textbf{asymptotically linear} estimator, obtaining statistical
inference is very convenient. Each TML estimator has a corresponding
\textbf{(efficient) influence function} (often, ``EIF'', for short) that describes the
asymptotic distribution of the estimator. By using the estimated EIF, Wald-style
inference (asymptotically correct confidence intervals) can be constructed
simply by plugging into the form of the EIF our initial estimates
\(\overline{Q}_n\) and \(g_n\), then computing the sample standard error.

The following sections describe both a simple and more detailed way of
specifying and estimating a TMLE in the \passthrough{\lstinline!tlverse!}. In designing \passthrough{\lstinline!tmle3!}, we
sought to replicate as closely as possible the very general estimation framework
of TMLE, and so each theoretical object relevant to TMLE is encoded in a
corresponding software object/method. First, we will present the simple
application of \passthrough{\lstinline!tmle3!} to the WASH Benefits example, and then go on to describe
the underlying objects in greater detail.

\hypertarget{easy-bake-example-tmle3-for-ate}{%
\section{\texorpdfstring{Easy-Bake Example: \texttt{tmle3} for ATE}{Easy-Bake Example: tmle3 for ATE}}\label{easy-bake-example-tmle3-for-ate}}

We'll illustrate the most basic use of TMLE using the WASH Benefits data
introduced earlier and estimating an average treatment effect.

\hypertarget{load-the-data-1}{%
\subsection{Load the Data}\label{load-the-data-1}}

We'll use the same WASH Benefits data as the earlier chapters:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=R]
library(data.table)
library(dplyr)
library(tmle3)
library(sl3)
washb_data <- fread(
  paste0(
    "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tlverse/tlverse-data/master/",
    "wash-benefits/washb_data.csv"
  ),
  stringsAsFactors = TRUE
)
\end{lstlisting}

\hypertarget{define-the-variable-roles}{%
\subsection{Define the variable roles}\label{define-the-variable-roles}}

We'll use the common \(W\) (covariates), \(A\) (treatment/intervention), \(Y\)
(outcome) data structure. \passthrough{\lstinline!tmle3!} needs to know what variables in the dataset
correspond to each of these roles. We use a list of character vectors to tell
it. We call this a ``Node List'' as it corresponds to the nodes in a Directed
Acyclic Graph (DAG), a way of displaying causal relationships between variables.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=R]
node_list <- list(
  W = c(
    "month", "aged", "sex", "momage", "momedu",
    "momheight", "hfiacat", "Nlt18", "Ncomp", "watmin",
    "elec", "floor", "walls", "roof", "asset_wardrobe",
    "asset_table", "asset_chair", "asset_khat",
    "asset_chouki", "asset_tv", "asset_refrig",
    "asset_bike", "asset_moto", "asset_sewmach",
    "asset_mobile"
  ),
  A = "tr",
  Y = "whz"
)
\end{lstlisting}

\hypertarget{handle-missingness}{%
\subsection{Handle Missingness}\label{handle-missingness}}

Currently, missingness in \passthrough{\lstinline!tmle3!} is handled in a fairly simple way:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Missing covariates are median- (for continuous) or mode- (for discrete)
  imputed, and additional covariates indicating imputation are generated, just
  as described in \protect\hyperlink{sl3}{the \passthrough{\lstinline!sl3!} chapter}.
\item
  Missing treatment variables are excluded -- such observations are dropped.
\item
  Missing outcomes are efficiently handled by the automatic calculation (and
  incorporation into estimators) of \emph{inverse probability of censoring weights}
  (IPCW); this is also known as IPCW-TMLE and may be thought of as a joint
  intervention to remove missingness and is analogous to the procedure used with
  classical inverse probability weighted estimators.
\end{itemize}

These steps are implemented in the \passthrough{\lstinline!process\_missing!} function in \passthrough{\lstinline!tmle3!}:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=R]
processed <- process_missing(washb_data, node_list)
washb_data <- processed$data
node_list <- processed$node_list
\end{lstlisting}

\hypertarget{create-a-spec-object}{%
\subsection{Create a ``Spec'' Object}\label{create-a-spec-object}}

\passthrough{\lstinline!tmle3!} is general, and allows most components of the TMLE procedure to be
specified in a modular way. However, most users will not be interested in
manually specifying all of these components. Therefore, \passthrough{\lstinline!tmle3!} implements a
\passthrough{\lstinline!tmle3\_Spec!} object that bundles a set of components into a \emph{specification}
(``Spec'') that, with minimal additional detail, can be run to fit a TMLE.

We'll start with using one of the specs, and then work our way down into the
internals of \passthrough{\lstinline!tmle3!}.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=R]
ate_spec <- tmle_ATE(
  treatment_level = "Nutrition + WSH",
  control_level = "Control"
)
\end{lstlisting}

\hypertarget{define-the-learners}{%
\subsection{Define the learners}\label{define-the-learners}}

Currently, the only other thing a user must define are the \passthrough{\lstinline!sl3!} learners used
to estimate the relevant factors of the likelihood: Q and g.

This takes the form of a list of \passthrough{\lstinline!sl3!} learners, one for each likelihood factor
to be estimated with \passthrough{\lstinline!sl3!}:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=R]
# choose base learners
lrnr_mean <- make_learner(Lrnr_mean)
lrnr_rf <- make_learner(Lrnr_ranger)

# define metalearners appropriate to data types
ls_metalearner <- make_learner(Lrnr_nnls)
mn_metalearner <- make_learner(
  Lrnr_solnp, metalearner_linear_multinomial,
  loss_loglik_multinomial
)
sl_Y <- Lrnr_sl$new(
  learners = list(lrnr_mean, lrnr_rf),
  metalearner = ls_metalearner
)
sl_A <- Lrnr_sl$new(
  learners = list(lrnr_mean, lrnr_rf),
  metalearner = mn_metalearner
)
learner_list <- list(A = sl_A, Y = sl_Y)
\end{lstlisting}

Here, we use a Super Learner as defined in the previous chapter. In the future,
we plan to include reasonable defaults learners.

\hypertarget{fit-the-tmle}{%
\subsection{Fit the TMLE}\label{fit-the-tmle}}

We now have everything we need to fit the tmle using \passthrough{\lstinline!tmle3!}:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=R]
tmle_fit <- tmle3(ate_spec, washb_data, node_list, learner_list)
print(tmle_fit)
A tmle3_Fit that took 1 step(s)
   type                                    param  init_est tmle_est      se
1:  ATE ATE[Y_{A=Nutrition + WSH}-Y_{A=Control}] -0.005233 0.007111 0.05025
      lower  upper psi_transformed lower_transformed upper_transformed
1: -0.09139 0.1056        0.007111          -0.09139            0.1056
\end{lstlisting}

\hypertarget{evaluate-the-estimates}{%
\subsection{Evaluate the Estimates}\label{evaluate-the-estimates}}

We can see the summary results by printing the fit object. Alternatively, we
can extra results from the summary by indexing into it:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=R]
estimates <- tmle_fit$summary$psi_transformed
print(estimates)
[1] 0.007111
\end{lstlisting}

\hypertarget{tmle3-components}{%
\section{\texorpdfstring{\texttt{tmle3} Components}{tmle3 Components}}\label{tmle3-components}}

Now that we've successfully used a spec to obtain a TML estimate, let's look
under the hood at the components. The spec has a number of functions that
generate the objects necessary to define and fit a TMLE.

\hypertarget{tmle3_task}{%
\subsection{\texorpdfstring{\texttt{tmle3\_task}}{tmle3\_task}}\label{tmle3_task}}

First is, a \passthrough{\lstinline!tmle3\_Task!}, analogous to an \passthrough{\lstinline!sl3\_Task!}, containing the data we're
fitting the TMLE to, as well as an NPSEM generated from the \passthrough{\lstinline!node\_list!}
defined above, describing the variables and their relationships.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=R]
tmle_task <- ate_spec$make_tmle_task(washb_data, node_list)
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=R]
tmle_task$npsem
$W
tmle3_Node: W
    Variables: month, aged, sex, momedu, hfiacat, Nlt18, Ncomp, watmin, elec, floor, walls, roof, asset_wardrobe, asset_table, asset_chair, asset_khat, asset_chouki, asset_tv, asset_refrig, asset_bike, asset_moto, asset_sewmach, asset_mobile, momage, momheight, delta_momage, delta_momheight
    Parents: 

$A
tmle3_Node: A
    Variables: tr
    Parents: W

$Y
tmle3_Node: Y
    Variables: whz
    Parents: A, W
\end{lstlisting}

\hypertarget{initial-likelihood}{%
\subsection{Initial Likelihood}\label{initial-likelihood}}

Next, is an object representing the likelihood, factorized according to the
NPSEM described above:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=R]
initial_likelihood <- ate_spec$make_initial_likelihood(
  tmle_task,
  learner_list
)
print(initial_likelihood)
W: Lf_emp
A: LF_fit
Y: LF_fit
\end{lstlisting}

These components of the likelihood indicate how the factors were estimated: the
marginal distribution of \(W\) was estimated using NP-MLE, and the conditional
distributions of \(A\) and \(Y\) were estimated using \passthrough{\lstinline!sl3!} fits (as defined with
the \passthrough{\lstinline!learner\_list!}) above.

We can use this in tandem with the \passthrough{\lstinline!tmle\_task!} object to obtain likelihood
estimates for each observation:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=R]
initial_likelihood$get_likelihoods(tmle_task)
             W      A       Y
   1: 0.000213 0.3302 -0.3550
   2: 0.000213 0.3398 -0.9297
   3: 0.000213 0.3287 -0.8058
   4: 0.000213 0.3247 -0.9373
   5: 0.000213 0.3238 -0.5755
  ---                        
4691: 0.000213 0.2131 -0.5868
4692: 0.000213 0.2130 -0.2243
4693: 0.000213 0.2073 -0.7393
4694: 0.000213 0.2580 -0.9151
4695: 0.000213 0.1821 -1.0360
\end{lstlisting}

\hypertarget{targeted-likelihood-updater}{%
\subsection{Targeted Likelihood (updater)}\label{targeted-likelihood-updater}}

We also need to define a ``Targeted Likelihood'' object. This is a special type
of likelihood that is able to be updated using an \passthrough{\lstinline!tmle3\_Update!} object. This
object defines the update strategy (e.g., submodel, loss function, CV-TMLE or
not).

\begin{lstlisting}[language=R]
targeted_likelihood <- Targeted_Likelihood$new(initial_likelihood)
\end{lstlisting}

When constructing the targeted likelihood, you can specify different update
options. See the documentation for \passthrough{\lstinline!tmle3\_Update!} for details of the different
options. For example, you can disable CV-TMLE (the default in \passthrough{\lstinline!tmle3!}) as
follows:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=R]
targeted_likelihood_no_cv <-
  Targeted_Likelihood$new(initial_likelihood,
    updater = list(cvtmle = FALSE)
  )
\end{lstlisting}

\hypertarget{parameter-mapping}{%
\subsection{Parameter Mapping}\label{parameter-mapping}}

Finally, we need to define the parameters of interest. Here, the spec defines a
single parameter, the ATE. In the next section, we'll see how to add additional
parameters.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=R]
tmle_params <- ate_spec$make_params(tmle_task, targeted_likelihood)
print(tmle_params)
[[1]]
Param_ATE: ATE[Y_{A=Nutrition + WSH}-Y_{A=Control}]
\end{lstlisting}

\hypertarget{putting-it-all-together}{%
\subsection{Putting it all together}\label{putting-it-all-together}}

Having used the spec to manually generate all these components, we can now
manually fit a \passthrough{\lstinline!tmle3!}:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=R]
tmle_fit_manual <- fit_tmle3(
  tmle_task, targeted_likelihood, tmle_params,
  targeted_likelihood$updater
)
print(tmle_fit_manual)
A tmle3_Fit that took 1 step(s)
   type                                    param  init_est tmle_est      se
1:  ATE ATE[Y_{A=Nutrition + WSH}-Y_{A=Control}] -0.004549  0.01096 0.05046
      lower  upper psi_transformed lower_transformed upper_transformed
1: -0.08794 0.1099         0.01096          -0.08794            0.1099
\end{lstlisting}

The result is equivalent to fitting using the \passthrough{\lstinline!tmle3!} function as above.

\hypertarget{fitting-tmle3-with-multiple-parameters}{%
\section{\texorpdfstring{Fitting \texttt{tmle3} with multiple parameters}{Fitting tmle3 with multiple parameters}}\label{fitting-tmle3-with-multiple-parameters}}

Above, we fit a \passthrough{\lstinline!tmle3!} with just one parameter. \passthrough{\lstinline!tmle3!} also supports fitting
multiple parameters simultaneously. To illustrate this, we'll use the
\passthrough{\lstinline!tmle\_TSM\_all!} spec:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=R]
tsm_spec <- tmle_TSM_all()
targeted_likelihood <- Targeted_Likelihood$new(initial_likelihood)
all_tsm_params <- tsm_spec$make_params(tmle_task, targeted_likelihood)
print(all_tsm_params)
[[1]]
Param_TSM: E[Y_{A=Control}]

[[2]]
Param_TSM: E[Y_{A=Handwashing}]

[[3]]
Param_TSM: E[Y_{A=Nutrition}]

[[4]]
Param_TSM: E[Y_{A=Nutrition + WSH}]

[[5]]
Param_TSM: E[Y_{A=Sanitation}]

[[6]]
Param_TSM: E[Y_{A=WSH}]

[[7]]
Param_TSM: E[Y_{A=Water}]
\end{lstlisting}

This spec generates a Treatment Specific Mean (TSM) for each level of the
exposure variable. Note that we must first generate a new targeted likelihood,
as the old one was targeted to the ATE. However, we can recycle the initial
likelihood we fit above, saving us a super learner step.

\hypertarget{delta-method}{%
\subsection{Delta Method}\label{delta-method}}

We can also define parameters based on Delta Method Transformations of other
parameters. For instance, we can estimate a ATE using the delta method and two

Follow the steps below to estimate an average treatment effect using data from
the Collaborative Perinatal Project (CPP), available in the \passthrough{\lstinline!sl3!} package. To
simplify this example, we define a binary intervention variable, \passthrough{\lstinline!parity01!} --
an indicator of having one or more children before the current child and a

  \passthrough{\lstinline!gagebrth!}, \passthrough{\lstinline!mage!}, \passthrough{\lstinline!meducyrs!}, \passthrough{\lstinline!sexn!}. Both \(A\) and \(Y\) are specified

  specified in Step 1; and (4) the list of super learners for estimation of
  \(g_0\) and \(\overline{Q}_0\), which we defined in Step 6. \emph{Note}: Like before,
  you will need to explicitly make a copy of the data (to work around
  \passthrough{\lstinline!data.table!} optimizations), e.g., (\passthrough{\lstinline!cpp2 <- data.table::copy(cpp)!}), then
  use the \passthrough{\lstinline!cpp2!} data going forward.

\passthrough{\lstinline!tmle3!} is a general purpose framework for generating TML estimates. The easiest
way to use it is to use a predefined spec, allowing you to just fill in the
blanks for the data, variable roles, and \passthrough{\lstinline!sl3!} learners. However, digging under
the hood allows users to specify a wide range of TMLEs. In the next sections,
we'll see how this framework can be used to estimate advanced parameters such as
optimal treatments and stochastic shift interventions.

\section{Introduction to Optimal Individualized Interventions}\label{introduction-to-optimal-individualized-interventions}}

Identifying which intervention will be effective for which patient based on
lifestyle, genetic and environmental factors is a common goal in precision
medicine. To put it in context, Abacavir and Tenofovir are commonly prescribed
as part of the antiretroviral therapy to Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)
patients. However, not all individuals benefit from the two medications equally.
In particular, patients with renal dysfunction might further deteriorate if
prescribed Tenofovir, due to the high nephrotoxicity caused by the medication.
While Tenofovir is still highly effective treatment option for HIV patients, in
order to maximize the patient's well-being, it would be beneficial to prescribe
Tenofovir only to individuals with healthy kidney function. As an another example,
consider a HIV trial where our goal is to improve retention in HIV care.
In a randomized clinical trial, several interventions show efficacy- including
appointment reminders through text messages, small cash incentives for on time
clinic visits, and peer health workers. Ideally, we want to improve effectiveness
by assigning each patient the intervention they are most likely to benefit from,
as well as improve efficiency by not allocating resources to individuals that do not need
them, or would not benefit from it.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{img/png/DynamicA_Illustration}

\caption{Dynamic Treatment Regime in a Clinical Setting}\label{fig:unnamed-chunk-1}
\end{figure}

One opts to administer the intervention to individuals who will profit from it,
instead of assigning treatment on a population level. But how do we know which
intervention works for which patient? This aim motivates a different type of
intervention, as opposed to the static exposures we described in previous chapters.
In particular, in this chapter we learn about dynamic or ``individualized''
interventions that tailor the treatment decision based on the collected
covariates. Formally, dynamic treatments represent interventions that at each
treatment-decision stage are allowed to respond to the currently available
treatment and covariate history. A dynamic treatment rule can be thought of as
a rule where the input is the available set of collected covariates, and the
output is an individualized treatment for each patient
\citep{bembom2007realistic, robins1986, moodie2013}.

In the statistics community such a treatment strategy is termed an
\textbf{individualized treatment regime} (ITR), also known as the optimal
dynamic treatment rule, optimal treatment regime, optimal strategy,
and optimal policy \citep{murphy2003, robins2004}. The (counterfactual)
population mean outcome under an ITR is the value of the ITR \citep{murphy2003, robins2004}.
Even more, suppose one wishes to maximize the population mean of an
outcome, where for each individual we have access to some set of measured
covariates. This means, for example, that we can learn for which individual
characteristics assigning treatment increases the probability of a beneficial
outcome. An ITR with the maximal value is referred to as an
optimal ITR or the \textbf{optimal individualized treatment}. Consequently, the value
of an optimal ITR is termed the optimal value, or the
\textbf{mean under the optimal individualized treatment}.

The problem of estimating the optimal individualized treatment has received much
attention in the statistics literature over the years, especially with the
advancement of precision medicine; see \citet{murphy2003}, \citet{robins2004}, \citet{laber2012},
\citet{kosorok2012}, \citet{moodie2013} and \citet{robins2014} to name a few. However, much of the
early work depends on parametric assumptions. As such, even in a randomized
trial, the statistical inference for the optimal individualized treatment relies
on assumptions that are generally believed to be false, and can lead to biased
results.

In this chapter, we consider estimation of the mean outcome under the optimal
individualized treatment where the candidate rules are restricted to depend only
on user-supplied subset of the baseline covariates. The estimation problem is
addressed in a statistical model for the data distribution that is
nonparametric, and at most places restrictions on the probability of a patient
receiving treatment given covariates (as in a randomized trial). As such, we
don't need to make any assumptions about the relationship of the outcome with
the treatment and covariates, or the relationship between the treatment and
covariates. Further, we provide a Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimator for the
mean under the optimal individualized treatment that allows us to generate valid
inference for our parameter, without having any parametric assumptions.

In the following, we provide a brief overview of the methodology with a focus on
building intuition for the target parameter and its importance --- aided with simulations,
data examples and software demonstrations. For more information on the technical aspects
of the algorithm, further practical advice and overview, the interested reader is invited to
additionally consult \citet{vanderLaanLuedtke15}, \citet{luedtke2016super}, \citet{montoya2021optimal} and

\hypertarget{data-structure-and-notation}{%
\section{Data Structure and Notation}\label{data-structure-and-notation}}

Suppose we observe \(n\) independent and identically distributed observations of
the form \(O=(W,A,Y) \sim P_0\). We denote \(A\) as categorical treatment, and \(Y\)
as the final outcome. In particular, we define \(A \in \mathcal{A}\) where
\(\mathcal{A} \equiv \{a_1, \cdots, a_{n_A} \}\) and \(n_A = |\mathcal{A}|\), with
\(n_A\) denoting the number of categories (possibly only two, for a binary setup).
Note that we treat \(W\) as vector-valued, representing all of our collected
baseline covariates. Therefore, for a single random individual \(i\), we have that
their observed data is \(O_i\): with corresponding baseline covariates \(W_i\),
treatment \(A_i\), and final outcome \(Y_i\). Let \(O^n = \{O_i\}_{i=1}^n\) denote
\(n\) observed samples. Then, we say that \(O^n \sim P_0\), or that all
data was drawn from some true probability distribution \(P_0\). Let \(\mathcal{M}\)
denote a statistical model for the probability distribution of the data that is
nonparametric, beyond possible knowledge of the treatment mechanism. In words, this
means that we make no assumptions on the relationship between variables, but might
be able to say something about the relationship of \(A\) and \(W\), as is the case in
a randomized trial. In general, the more we know, or are willing to assume about the
experiment that produces the data, the smaller the model. The true data generating
distribution \(P_0\) is part of the statistical model \(\mathcal{M}\), and we write
\(P_0 \in \mathcal{M}\). As in previous chapters, we denote \(P_n\) as the empirical distribution
which gives each observation weight \(1/n\).

We use the structural equation model (SEM) in order to define
the process that gives rise to the observed (endogenous) and not observed
(exogenous) variables, as described by \citet{pearl2009causality}. In particular, we
denote \(U=(U_W,U_A,U_Y)\) as the exogenous random variables, drawn from \(U \sim P_U\).
The endogenous variables, written as \(O=(W,A,Y)\), correspond to the observed data.
We can define the relationships between variables with the following structural equations:
\begin{align}
  W &= f_W(U_W) \\ A &= f_A(W, U_A) \\ Y &= f_Y(A, W, U_Y),
  \label{eq:npsem-mopttx}
\end{align}
where the collection \(f=(f_W,f_A,f_Y)\) denotes unspecified functions, beyond possible
knowledge of the treatment mechanism function, \(f_A\). Note that
in the case of a randomized trial, we can write the above NPSEM as
\begin{align}
  W &= f_W(U_W) \\ A &= U_A \\ Y &= f_Y(A, W, U_Y),
  \label{eq:npsem-rt-mopttx}
\end{align}
where \(U_A\) has a known distribution and \(U_A\) is independent of \(U_W\). We will discuss
this more in later sections on identifiability.

The likelihood of the data admits a factorization, implied by the time ordering
of \(O\). We denote the true density of \(O\) as \(p_0\), corresponding to the
distribution \(P_0\) and dominating measure \(\mu\).
\begin{equation}
  p_0(O) = p_{Y,0}(Y \mid A,W) p_{A,0}(A \mid W) p_{W,0}(W) =
    q_{Y,0}(Y \mid A,W) g_{A,0}(A \mid W) q_{W,0}(W),
  \label{eq:likelihood-factorization-mopttx}
\end{equation}
where \(p_{Y,0}(Y|A,W)\) is the conditional density of \(Y\) given \((A, W)\) with
respect to some dominating measure \(\mu_Y\), \(p_{A,0}\) is the conditional density
of \(A\) given \(W\) with respect to a counting measure \(\mu_A\), and \(p_{W,0}\) is
the density of \(W\) with respect to dominating measure \(\mu_W\). In order to
match relevant Targeted Learning literature, we also
write \(P_{Y,0}(Y \mid A, W) = Q_{Y,0}(Y \mid A,W)\), \(P_{A,0}(A \mid W) = g_0(A \mid W)\)
and \(P_{W,0}(W)=Q_{W,0}(W)\) as the corresponding conditional
distribution of \(Y\) given \((A,W)\), treatment mechanism \(A\) given \(W\), and
distribution of baseline covariates. For notational simplicity, we additionally define
\(\bar{Q}_{Y,0}(A,W) \equiv \E_0[Y \mid A,W]\) as the conditional expectation of
\(Y\) given \((A,W)\).

Lastly, we define \(V\) as a subset of the baseline covariates the optimal
individualized rule depends on, where \(V \in W\). Note that \(V\) could be all of
\(W\), or an empty set, depending on the subject matter knowledge. In particular,
a researcher might want to consider known effect modifiers available at the time
of treatment decision as possible \(V\) covariates, or consider dynamic treatment
rules based on measurments that can be easily obtained in a clinical setting.
Defining \(V\) as a more restrictive set of baseline covariates allows us to consider
possibly sub-optimal rules that are easier to estimate, and thereby allows for
statistical inference for the counterfactual mean outcome under the sub-optimal rule;
we will elaborate on this in later sections.

\hypertarget{defining-the-causal-effect-of-an-optimal-individualized-intervention}{%
\section{Defining the Causal Effect of an Optimal Individualized Intervention}\label{defining-the-causal-effect-of-an-optimal-individualized-intervention}}

Consider dynamic treatment rules, denoted as \(d\), in the set of all possible rules
\(\mathcal{D}\). Then, in a point treatment setting, \(d\) is a deterministic function
that takes as input \(V\) and outputs a treatment decision where
\(V \rightarrow d(V) \in \{a_1, \cdots, a_{n_A} \}\). We will use dynamic treatment rules,
and the corresponding treatment decision, to describe an intervention on the
treatment mechanism and the corresponding outcome under a dynamic treatment rule.

As mentioned in the previous section, causal effects are defined in terms of
hypothetical interventions on the SEM \eqref{eq:npsem-mopttx}. For a given
rule \(d\), our modified system then takes the following form:
\begin{align}
  W &= f_W(U_W) \\ A &= d(V) \\ Y_{d(V)} &= f_Y(d(V), W, U_Y),
  \label{eq:npsem-causal-mopttx}
\end{align}
where the dynamic treatment regime may be viewed as an intervention in which \(A\)
is set equal to a value based on a hypothetical regime \(d(V)\). The couterfactual outcome
\(Y_{d(V)}\) denotes the outcome for a patient had their treatment been assigned using the
dynamic rule \(d(V)\), possibly contrary to the fact. Similarly, the counterfactual
outcomes had all patients been assigned treatment (\(A=1\)), or given control (\(A=0\)), are
written as \(Y_1\) and \(Y_0\). Finally, we denote the distribution of the counterfactual outcomes
as \(P_{U,X}\), implied by the distribution of exogenous variables \(U\) and structural
equations \(f\). The set of all possible counterfactual distributions are encompased
by the causal model \(\mathcal{M}^F\), where \(P_{U,X} \in \mathcal{M}^F\).

The goal of any causal analysis motivated by such dynamic interventions is to
estimate a parameter defined as the counterfactual mean of the outcome with
respect to the modified intervention distribution. That is, subject's outcome if,
possibly contrary to the fact, the subject received treatment that would have been
assigned by rule \(d(V)\). Equivalently, we ask the following causal question:
``What is the expected outcome had every subject received treatment according to the
(optimal) individualized treatment?'' In order to estimate the optimal individualized
treatment, we set the following optimization problem:

\[d_{opt}(V) \equiv \text{argmax}_{d(V) \in \mathcal{D}}
\E_{P_{U,X}}[Y_{d(V)}], \]
where the optimal individualized rule is the rule with the maximal value. We note that, in case
the problem at hand requires minimizing the mean of an outcome, our optimal individualized
rule will be the rule with the minimal value instead.

With that in mind, we can consider different
treatment rules, all in the set \(\mathcal{D}\):

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  The true rule, \(d_{0,\text{opt}}\), and the corresponding causal parameter
  \(\E_{U,X}[Y_{d_{0,\text{opt}}(V)}]\) denoting the expected outcome under the
  true optimal treatment rule \(d_{0,\text{opt}}(V)\).
\item
  The estimated rule, \(d_{n,\text{opt}}\), and the corresponding causal parameter
  \(\E_{U,X}[Y_{d_{n,\text{opt}}(V)}]\) denoting the expected outcome under the
  estimated optimal treatment rule \(d_{n,\text{opt}}(V)\).
\end{enumerate}

In this chapter, we will focus on the value under the estimated optimal rule \(d_{n,\text{opt}}\),
a \textbf{data-adaptive parameter}. Note that its true value depends on the sample! Finally,
our causal target parameter of interest is the expected outcome under
the estimated optimal individualized rule:

\[\Psi_{d_{n, \text{opt}}(V)}(P_{U,X}) \coloneqq \E_{P_{U,X}}[Y_{d_{n,
\text{opt}}(V)}].\]

\hypertarget{identification-and-statistical-estimand}{%
\subsection{Identification and Statistical Estimand}\label{identification-and-statistical-estimand}}

The optimal individualized rule, as well as the value of an optimal
individualized rule, are causal parameters based on the unobserved
counterfactuals. In order for the causal quantities to be estimated from the
observed data, they need to be identified with statistical parameters. This step
of the roadmap requires we make a few assumptions:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \emph{Strong ignorability}: \(A \indep Y^{d_{n, \text{opt}}(v)} \mid W\), for all \(a \in \mathcal{A}\).
\item
  \emph{Positivity (or overlap)}: \(P_0(\min_{a \in \mathcal{A}} g_0(a \mid W) > 0) = 1\)
\end{enumerate}

Under the above assumptions, we can identify the causal target parameter
with observed data using the G-computation formula. The value of an individualized
rule can now be expressed as

\[\E_0[Y_{d_{n, \text{opt}}(V)}] = \E_{0,W}[\bar{Q}_{Y,0}(A=d_{n, \text{opt}}(V),W)],\]

which, under assumptions, is interpreted as the mean outcome if
(possibly contrary to fact), treatment was assigned according to the optimal rule.
Finally, the statistical counterpart to the causal parameter of interest is
defined as

\[\psi_0 = \E_{0,W}[\bar{Q}_{Y,0}(A=d_{n,\text{opt}}(V),W)].\]

Inference for the optimal value has been shown to be difficult at exceptional
laws, defined as probability distributions for which there is a positive
probability on a set of \(W\) values for which conditional expectation of \(Y\)
given \(A\) and \(W\) is constant in \(a\) - so all treatments are equally
benefitial. Inference is similarly difficult in finite samples if
the treatment effect is very small in all strata, even though valid asymptotic
estimators exist in this setting. With that in mind, we address the estimation
problem under the assumption of non-exceptional laws in effect.

Many methods for learning the optimal rule from data have been developed
\citep{murphy2003, robins2004, laber2012, kosorok2012, moodie2013}. In this
chapter, we focus on the methods discussed in \citet{luedtke2016super} and
\citet{vanderLaanLuedtke15}. Note however, that \passthrough{\lstinline!tmle3mopttx!} also supports the widely
used Q-learning approach, where the optimal individualized rule is based on the
initial estimate of \(\bar{Q}_{Y,0}(A,W)\) \citep{Sutton1998}.

We follow the methodology outlined in \citet{luedtke2016super} and
\citet{vanderLaanLuedtke15}, where we learn the optimal ITR using Super Learner
\citep{vdl2007super}, and estimate its value with cross-validated Targeted Minimum
Loss-based Estimation (CV-TMLE) \citep{cvtmle2010}. In great generality, we first
need to estimate the true individual treatment regime, \(d_0(V)\), which
corresponds to dynamic treatment rule that takes a subset of covariates
\(V\) and assigns treatment to each individual based on their observed
covariates \(v\). With the estimate of the true optimal ITR in hand, we can
estimate its corresponding value.

\hypertarget{binary-treatment}{%
\subsection{Binary treatment}\label{binary-treatment}}

How do we estimate the optimal individualized treatment regime? In the case of a
binary treatment, a key quantity for optimal ITR is the \textbf{blip function}. One can
show that any optimal ITR assigns treatment to individuals falling in strata in
which the stratum specific average treatment effect, the blip, is
positive and does not assign treatment to individuals for which this quantity is
negative. Therefore for a binary treatment, under causal assumptions, we define
the blip function as:
\[\bar{Q}_0(V) \equiv \E_0[Y_1-Y_0 \mid V] \equiv \E_0[\bar{Q}_{Y,0}(1,W) -
\bar{Q}_{Y,0}(0,W) \mid V],\]
or the average treatment effect within a stratum of \(V\). The note that the
optimal individualized rule can now be derived as \(d_{n,\text{opt}}(V) = \mathbb{I}(\bar{Q}_{n}(V) > 0)\).

The package \passthrough{\lstinline!tmle3mopttx!} relies on using the Super Learner to estimate the blip
function. With that in mind, the loss function utilized for learning the optimal
individualized rule corresponds to conditional mean type losses. It is however worth
mentioning that \citet{luedtke2016super} present three different approaches for learning the optimal
rule. Namely, they focus on:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Super Learner of the blip function using the squared error loss,
\item
  Super Learner of \(d_0\) using the weighted classification loss function,
\item
  Super Learner of \(d_0\) that uses a library of candidate estimators that are
  implied by estimators of the blip as well as estimators that directly go for
  \(d_0\) through weighted classification.
\end{enumerate}

A benefit of relying on the blip function, as implemented in \passthrough{\lstinline!tmle3mopttx!}, is that
one can look at the distribution of the predicted outcomes of the blip for a given
sample. Having an estimate of the blip allows one to identify patients in the sample
who benefit the most (or the least) from treatment. Additionally, blip-based approach
allows for straight-forward extension to the categorical treatment, interpretable rules,
and OIT under resource constrains, where only a percent of the population can receive
treatment \citep{luedtke2016resource}.

Relying on the Targeted Maximum Likelihood (TML) estimator and the Super Learner
estimate of the blip function, we follow the below steps in order to obtain
value of the ITR:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Estimate \(\bar{Q}_{Y,0}(A,W)\) and \(g_0(A \mid W)\) using \passthrough{\lstinline!sl3!}. We denote such
  estimates as \(\bar{Q}_{Y,n}(A,W)\) and \(g_n(A \mid W)\).
\item
  Apply the doubly robust Augmented-Inverse Probability Weighted (A-IPW)
  transform to our outcome (double-robust pseudo-outcome), where we define:
  \[D_{\bar{Q}_Y,g,a}(O) \equiv \frac{\mathbb{I}(A=a)}{g(A \mid W)} (Y -
  \bar{Q}_Y(A,W)) + \bar{Q}_Y(A=a,W).\]
\end{enumerate}

Note that under the randomization and positivity assumptions we have that
\(\E[D_{\bar{Q}_Y,g,a}(O) \mid V] = \E[Y_a \mid V]\). We emphasize the double
robust nature of the A-IPW transform --- consistency of \(\E[Y_a \mid V]\) will depend
on correct estimation of either \(\bar{Q}_{Y,0}(A,W)\) or \(g_0(A \mid W)\). As
such, in a randomized trial, we are guaranteed a consistent estimate of \(\E[Y_a \mid V]\)
even if we get \(\bar{Q}_{Y,0}(A,W)\) wrong! An alternative to the double-robust pseudo-outcome
just presented would be single stage Q-learning, where an estimate \(\bar{Q}_{Y,0}(A,W)\)
is used to predict at \(\bar{Q}_{Y,n}(A=1,W)\) and \(\bar{Q}_{Y,n}(A=0,W)\). This provides
an estimate of the blip function, \(\bar{Q}_{Y,n}(A=1,W) - \bar{Q}_{Y,n}(A=0,W)\), but
relies on doing a good job on estimating \(\bar{Q}_{Y,0}(A,W)\).

Using the double-robust pseudo-outcome, we can define the following contrast:
\[D_{\bar{Q}_Y,g}(O) = D_{\bar{Q}_Y, g, a=1}(O) - D_{\bar{Q}_Y, g, a=0}(O).\]

We estimate the blip function, \(\bar{Q}_{0,a}(V)\), by regressing
\(D_{\bar{Q}_Y,g}(O)\) on \(V\) using the specified \passthrough{\lstinline!sl3!} library of learners and an
appropriate loss function. Finally, we are ready for the final steps.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{2}
\item
  Our estimated rule corresponds to \(\text{argmax}_{a \in \mathcal{A}} \bar{Q}_{0,a}(V)\).
\item
  We obtain inference for the mean outcome under the estimated optimal rule
  using CV-TMLE.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{categorical-treatment}{%
\subsection{Categorical treatment}\label{categorical-treatment}}

In line with the approach considered for binary treatment, we extend the blip
function to allow for categorical treatment. We denote such blip function
extensions as \emph{pseudo-blips}, which are our new estimation targets in a
categorical setting. We define pseudo-blips as vector-valued entities where the
output for a given \(V\) is a vector of length equal to the number of treatment
categories, \(n_A\). As such, we define it as:
\[\bar{Q}_0^{pblip}(V) = \{\bar{Q}_{0,a}^{pblip}(V): a \in \mathcal{A} \}\]

We implement three different pseudo-blips in \passthrough{\lstinline!tmle3mopttx!}.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \emph{Blip1} corresponds to choosing a reference category of treatment, and
  defining the blip for all other categories relative to the specified
  reference. Hence we have that:
  \[\bar{Q}_{0,a}^{pblip-ref}(V) \equiv \E_0[Y_a-Y_0 \mid V]\] where \(Y_0\) is
  the specified reference category with \(A=0\). Note that, for the case of
  binary treatment, this strategy reduces to the approach described for the
  binary setup.
\item
  \emph{Blip2} approach corresponds to defining the blip relative to the average of
  all categories. As such, we can define \(\bar{Q}_{0,a}^{pblip-avg}(V)\) as:
  \[\bar{Q}_{0,a}^{pblip-avg}(V) \equiv \E_0 [Y_a - \frac{1}{n_A} \sum_{a \in
    \mathcal{A}} Y_a \mid V].\]
  In the case where subject-matter knowledge regarding which reference category
  to use is not available, blip2 might be a viable option.
\item
  \emph{Blip3} reflects an extension of Blip2, where the average is now a weighted
  average:
  \[\bar{Q}_{0,a}^{pblip-wavg}(V) \equiv \E_0 [ Y_a - \frac{1}{n_A} \sum_{a \in
    \mathcal{A}} Y_{a} P(A=a \mid V) \mid V ].\]
\end{enumerate}

Just like in the binary case, pseudo-blips are estimated by regressing contrasts
composed using the A-IPW transform on \(V\).

\hypertarget{technical-note-inference-and-data-adaptive-parameter}{%
\subsection{Technical Note: Inference and data-adaptive parameter}\label{technical-note-inference-and-data-adaptive-parameter}}

In a randomized trial, statistical inference relies on the second-order
difference between the estimate of the optimal individualized treatment and the
optimal individualized treatment itself to be asymptotically negligible. This is
a reasonable condition if we consider rules that depend on a small number of
covariates, or if we are willing to make smoothness assumptions. Alternatively,
we can consider TMLEs and statistical inference for data-adaptive target
parameters defined in terms of an estimate of the optimal individualized
treatment. In particular, instead of trying to estimate the mean under the true
optimal individualized treatment, we aim to estimate the mean under the
estimated optimal individualized treatment. As such, we develop cross-validated
TMLE approach that provides asymptotic inference under minimal conditions for
the mean under the estimate of the optimal individualized treatment. In
particular, considering the data adaptive parameter allows us to avoid
consistency and rate condition for the fitted optimal rule, as required for
asymptotic linearity of the TMLE of the mean under the actual, true optimal
rule. Practically, the estimated (data-adaptive) rule should be preferred, as
this possibly sub-optimal rule is the one implemented in the population.

\hypertarget{technical-note-why-cv-tmle}{%
\subsection{Technical Note: Why CV-TMLE?}\label{technical-note-why-cv-tmle}}

As discussed in \citet{vanderLaanLuedtke15}, CV-TMLE is necessary as the
non-cross-validated TMLE is biased upward for the mean outcome under the rule,
and therefore overly optimistic. More generally however, using CV-TMLE allows us
more freedom in estimation and therefore greater data adaptivity, without
sacrificing inference.

\hypertarget{interpreting-the-causal-effect-of-an-optimal-individualized-intervention}{%
\section{Interpreting the Causal Effect of an Optimal Individualized Intervention}\label{interpreting-the-causal-effect-of-an-optimal-individualized-intervention}}

In summary, the mean outcome under the optimal individualized treatment is a
counterfactual quantity of interest representing what the mean outcome would
have been if everybody, contrary to the fact, received treatment that optimized
their outcome. The optimal individualized treatment regime is a rule that
optimizes the mean outcome under the dynamic treatment, where the candidate
rules are restricted to only respond to a user-supplied subset of the baseline
covariates. In essence, our target parameter answers the key
aim of precision medicine: allocating the available treatment by tailoring it to
the individual characteristics of the patient, with the goal of optimizing the
final outcome.

\hypertarget{oit-eval-bin}{%
\section{Evaluating the Causal Effect of an OIT with Binary Treatment}\label{oit-eval-bin}}

Finally, we demonstrate how to evaluate the mean outcome under the optimal
individualized treatment using \passthrough{\lstinline!tmle3mopptx!}. To start, let's load the packages
we'll use and set a seed:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=R]
library(data.table)
library(sl3)
library(tmle3)
library(tmle3mopttx)
library(devtools)

set.seed(111)
\end{lstlisting}

\hypertarget{simulated-data}{%
\subsection{Simulated Data}\label{simulated-data}}

First, we load the simulated data. We will start with the more general setup
where the treatment is a binary variable; later in the chapter we will consider
another data-generating distribution where \(A\) is categorical. In this example,
our data generating distribution is of the following form:
\begin{align*}
  W &\sim \mathcal{N}(\bf{0},I_{3 \times 3})\\
  \P(A=1 \mid W) &= \frac{1}{1+\exp^{(-0.8*W_1)}}\\
  \P(Y=1 \mid A,W) &= 0.5\text{logit}^{-1}[-5I(A=1)(W_1-0.5)+5I(A=0)(W_1-0.5)] +
     0.5\text{logit}^{-1}(W_2W_3)
\end{align*}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=R]
data("data_bin")
\end{lstlisting}

The above composes our observed data structure \(O = (W, A, Y)\). Note that the
truth is \(\psi=0.578\) for this data generating distribution.

To formally express this fact using the \passthrough{\lstinline!tlverse!} grammar introduced by the
\passthrough{\lstinline!tmle3!} package, we create a single data object and specify the functional
relationships between the nodes in the \emph{directed acyclic graph} (DAG) via
\emph{structural equation models} (SEMs), reflected in the node list
that we set up:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=R]
# organize data and nodes for tmle3
data <- data_bin
node_list <- list(
  W = c("W1", "W2", "W3"),
  A = "A",
  Y = "Y"
)
\end{lstlisting}

We now have an observed data structure (\passthrough{\lstinline!data!}) and a specification of the role
that each variable in the dataset plays as the nodes in a DAG.

\hypertarget{constructing-optimal-stacked-regressions-with-sl3}{%
\subsection{\texorpdfstring{Constructing Optimal Stacked Regressions with \texttt{sl3}}{Constructing Optimal Stacked Regressions with sl3}}\label{constructing-optimal-stacked-regressions-with-sl3}}

To easily incorporate ensemble machine learning into the estimation procedure,
we rely on the facilities provided in the \href{https://tlverse.org/sl3}{\passthrough{\lstinline!sl3!} R
package}. Using the framework provided by the \href{https://tlverse.org/sl3}{\passthrough{\lstinline!sl3!}
package}, the nuisance parameters of the TML estimator
may be fit with ensemble learning, using the cross-validation framework of the
Super Learner algorithm of \citet{vdl2007super}.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=R]
# Define sl3 library and metalearners:
lrn_xgboost_50 <- Lrnr_xgboost$new(nrounds = 50)
lrn_xgboost_100 <- Lrnr_xgboost$new(nrounds = 100)
lrn_xgboost_500 <- Lrnr_xgboost$new(nrounds = 500)

lrn_mean <- Lrnr_mean$new()
lrn_glm <- Lrnr_glm_fast$new()
lrn_lasso <- Lrnr_glmnet$new()

## Define the Q learner:
Q_learner <- Lrnr_sl$new(
  learners = list(lrn_lasso, lrn_mean, lrn_glm),
  metalearner = Lrnr_nnls$new()
)

## Define the g learner:
g_learner <- Lrnr_sl$new(
  learners = list(lrn_lasso, lrn_glm),
  metalearner = Lrnr_nnls$new()
)

## Define the B learner:
b_learner <- Lrnr_sl$new(
  learners = list(lrn_lasso,lrn_mean, lrn_glm),
  metalearner = Lrnr_nnls$new()
)
\end{lstlisting}

As seen above, we generate three different ensemble learners that must be fit,
corresponding to the learners for the outcome regression (Q), propensity score
(g), and the blip function (B). We make the above explicit with respect to
standard notation by bundling the ensemble learners into a list object below:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=R]
# specify outcome and treatment regressions and create learner list
learner_list <- list(Y = Q_learner, A = g_learner, B = b_learner)
\end{lstlisting}

The \passthrough{\lstinline!learner\_list!} object above specifies the role that each of the ensemble
learners we've generated is to play in computing initial estimators. Recall that
we need initial estimators of relevant parts of the likelihood in order to
build a TMLE for the parameter of interest. In particular, \passthrough{\lstinline!learner\_list!}
makes explicit the fact that our \passthrough{\lstinline!Y!} is used in fitting the outcome regression,
while \passthrough{\lstinline!A!} is used in fitting the treatment mechanism regression, and finally \passthrough{\lstinline!B!}
is used in fitting the blip function.

\hypertarget{targeted-estimation-of-the-mean-under-the-optimal-individualized-interventions-effects}{%
\subsection{Targeted Estimation of the Mean under the Optimal Individualized Interventions Effects}\label{targeted-estimation-of-the-mean-under-the-optimal-individualized-interventions-effects}}

To start, we will initialize a specification for the TMLE of our parameter of
interest simply by calling \passthrough{\lstinline!tmle3\_mopttx\_blip\_revere!}. We specify the argument
\passthrough{\lstinline!V = c("W1", "W2", "W3")!} when initializing the \passthrough{\lstinline!tmle3\_Spec!} object in order to
communicate that we're interested in learning a rule dependent on \passthrough{\lstinline!V!}
covariates. Note that we don't have to specify \passthrough{\lstinline!V!} --- this will result in a rule
that is not based on any collected covariates; we will see an example like this
shortly. We also need to specify the type
of (pseudo) blip we will use in this estimation problem, the list of learners used
to estimate the blip function, whether we want to maximize or minimize the final
outcome, and few other more advanced features including searching for a less
complex rule, realistic interventions and possible resource constraints.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=R]
# initialize a tmle specification
tmle_spec <- tmle3_mopttx_blip_revere(
  V = c("W1", "W2", "W3"), type = "blip1",
  learners = learner_list,
  maximize = TRUE, complex = TRUE,
  realistic = FALSE, resource = 1
)
\end{lstlisting}

As seen above, the \passthrough{\lstinline!tmle3\_mopttx\_blip\_revere!} specification object
(like all \passthrough{\lstinline!tmle3\_Spec!} objects) does \emph{not} store the data for our
specific analysis of interest. Later,
we'll see that passing a data object directly to the \passthrough{\lstinline!tmle3!} wrapper function,
alongside the instantiated \passthrough{\lstinline!tmle\_spec!}, will serve to construct a \passthrough{\lstinline!tmle3\_Task!}
object internally.

We elaborate more on the initialization specifications. In initializing the
specification for the TMLE of our parameter of interest, we have specified the
set of covariates the rule depends on (\passthrough{\lstinline!V!}), the type of (pseudo) blip to use
(\passthrough{\lstinline!type!}), and the learners used for estimating the relevant parts of the
likelihood and the blip function. In addition, we need to specify whether we
want to maximize the mean outcome under the rule (\passthrough{\lstinline!maximize!}), and whether we
want to estimate the rule under all the covariates \(V\) provided by the user
(\passthrough{\lstinline!complex!}). If \passthrough{\lstinline!FALSE!}, \passthrough{\lstinline!tmle3mopttx!} will instead consider all the possible
rules under a smaller set of covariates including the static rules, and optimize
the mean outcome over all the subsets of \(V\). As such, while the user might have
provided a full set of collected covariates as input for \(V\), it is possible
that the true rule only depends on a subset of the set provided by the user. In
that case, our returned mean under the optimal individualized rule will be based
on the smaller subset. In addition, we provide an option to search for realistic
optimal individualized interventions via the \passthrough{\lstinline!realistic!} specification. If
\passthrough{\lstinline!TRUE!}, only treatments supported by the data will be considered, therefore
alleviating concerns regarding practical positivity issues. Finally, we can incorporate
source constrains by setting \passthrough{\lstinline!resource!} argument to less than 1. We explore all the
important extensions of \passthrough{\lstinline!tmle3mopttx!} in later sections.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=R]
# fit the TML estimator
fit <- tmle3(tmle_spec, data, node_list, learner_list)
fit
A tmle3_Fit that took 1 step(s)
   type         param init_est tmle_est      se  lower  upper psi_transformed
1:  TSM E[Y_{A=NULL}]   0.3504   0.5508 0.02622 0.4994 0.6022          0.5508
   lower_transformed upper_transformed
1:            0.4994            0.6022
\end{lstlisting}

By studying the output generated, we can see that the confidence interval covers the
true parameter, as expected.

\hypertarget{resource-constraint}{%
\subsubsection{Resource constraint}\label{resource-constraint}}

We can restrict the number of individuals that get the treatment by only
treating \(k\) percent of samples. With that, only patients with the biggest benefit (according
to the estimated blip) receive treatment. In order to impose a
resource constraint, we only have to specify the percent of individuals that can
get treatment. For example, if \passthrough{\lstinline!resource=1!}, all
individuals with blip higher than zero will get treatment; if \passthrough{\lstinline!resource=0!},
noone will be treated.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=R]
# initialize a tmle specification
tmle_spec_resource <- tmle3_mopttx_blip_revere(
  V = c("W1", "W2", "W3"), type = "blip1",
  learners = learner_list,
  maximize = TRUE, complex = TRUE,
  realistic = FALSE, resource = 0.90
)
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=R]
# fit the TML estimator
fit_resource <- tmle3(tmle_spec_resource, data, node_list, learner_list)
fit_resource

   lower_transformed upper_transformed
1:            0.5074            0.6084
\end{lstlisting}

We can compare the number of individuals that got treatment with and without the
resource constraint:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=R]
# Number of individuals getting treatment (no resource constraint):
table(tmle_spec$return_rule)

  0   1 
275 725 

# Number of individuals getting treatment (resource constraint):

274 726 
\end{lstlisting}

\hypertarget{empty-v}{%

Below we the show an example where \(V\) is not specified, under the
resource constraint.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=R]

\end{lstlisting}

\hypertarget{oit-eval-cat}{%
\section{Evaluating the Causal Effect of an optimal ITR with Categorical Treatment}\label{oit-eval-cat}}

In this section, we consider how to evaluate the mean outcome under the optimal
individualized treatment when \(A\) has more than two categories. While the
procedure is analogous to the previously described binary treatment, we now need
to pay attention to the type of blip we define in the estimation stage, as well
as how we construct our learners.

\hypertarget{simulated-data-1}{%
\subsection{Simulated Data}\label{simulated-data-1}}

First, we load the simulated data. Our data generating distribution is
of the following form:
\begin{align*}
  W &\sim \mathcal{N}(\bf{0},I_{4 \times 4})\\
  \P(A=a \mid W) &= \frac{1}{1+\exp^{(-0.8*W_1)}}\\
  \P(Y=1 \mid A,W) = 0.5\text{logit}^{-1}[15I(A=1)(W_1-0.5) - \\
    3I(A=2)(2W_1+0.5) + \\
    3I(A=3)(3W_1-0.5)] +\text{logit}^{-1}(W_2W_1) \\
\end{align*}

We can just load the data available as part of the package as follows:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=R]
data("data_cat_realistic")
\end{lstlisting}

The above composes our observed data structure \(O = (W, A, Y)\). Note that the
truth is now \(\psi_0=0.658\), which is the quantity we aim to estimate.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=R]
# organize data and nodes for tmle3
data <- data_cat_realistic
node_list <- list(
  W = c("W1", "W2", "W3", "W4"),
  A = "A",
  Y = "Y"
)
\end{lstlisting}

We can see the number of observed categories of treatment below:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=R]
# organize data and nodes for tmle3
table(data$A)

  1   2   3 
 24 528 448

\hypertarget{constructing-optimal-stacked-regressions-with-sl3-1}{%
\subsection{\texorpdfstring{Constructing Optimal Stacked Regressions with \texttt{sl3}}{Constructing Optimal Stacked Regressions with sl3}}\label{constructing-optimal-stacked-regressions-with-sl3-1}}

\textbf{QUESTION:} With categorical treatment, what is the dimension of the blip now?
What is the dimension for the current example? How would we go about estimating it?

We will now create new ensemble learners using the
\passthrough{\lstinline!sl3!} learners initialized previously:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=R]
# Initialize few of the learners:
lrn_xgboost_50 <- Lrnr_xgboost$new(nrounds = 50)
lrn_xgboost_100 <- Lrnr_xgboost$new(nrounds = 100)
lrn_xgboost_500 <- Lrnr_xgboost$new(nrounds = 500)
lrn_mean <- Lrnr_mean$new()
lrn_glm <- Lrnr_glm_fast$new()

## Define the Q learner, which is just a regular learner:
Q_learner <- Lrnr_sl$new(
  learners = list(lrn_xgboost_100, lrn_mean, lrn_glm),
  metalearner = Lrnr_nnls$new()
)

# Define the g learner, which is a multinomial learner:
# specify the appropriate loss of the multinomial learner:
mn_metalearner <- make_learner(Lrnr_solnp,
  eval_function = loss_loglik_multinomial,
  learner_function = metalearner_linear_multinomial
)
g_learner <- make_learner(Lrnr_sl, list(lrn_xgboost_100, lrn_xgboost_500, lrn_mean), mn_metalearner)

# Define the Blip learner, which is a multivariate learner:
learners <- list(lrn_xgboost_50, lrn_xgboost_100, lrn_xgboost_500, lrn_mean, lrn_glm)
b_learner <- create_mv_learners(learners = learners)
\end{lstlisting}

As seen above, we generate three different ensemble learners that must be fit,
corresponding to the learners for the outcome regression, propensity score, and
the blip function. Note that we need to estimate \(g_0(A \mid W)\) for a
categorical \(A\) --- therefore, we use the multinomial Super Learner option
available within the \passthrough{\lstinline!sl3!} package with learners that can address multi-class
classification problems. In order to see which learners can be used to estimate
\(g_0(A \mid W)\) in \passthrough{\lstinline!sl3!}, we run the following:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=R]

Since the corresponding blip will be vector valued, we will have a
column for each additional level of treatment. As such, we need to create
multivariate learners with the helper function \passthrough{\lstinline!create\_mv\_learners!} that takes a
list of initialized learners as input.

We make the above explicit with respect to the standard notation by bundling the
ensemble learners into a list object below:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=R]
# specify outcome and treatment regressions and create learner list
learner_list <- list(Y = Q_learner, A = g_learner, B = b_learner)
\end{lstlisting}

\hypertarget{extensions-to-causal-effect-of-an-oit}{%
\section{Extensions to Causal Effect of an OIT}\label{extensions-to-causal-effect-of-an-oit}}

In this section, we consider two extensions to the procedure described for
estimating the value of the OIT. First one considers a setting where the user
might be interested in a grid of possible sub-optimal rules, corresponding to
potentially limited knowledge of potential effect modifiers. The second
extension concerns implementation of a realistic optimal individual
interventions where certain regimes might be preferred, but due to practical or
global positivity restraints, are not realistic to implement.

\hypertarget{oit-eval-cat-v2}{%
\subsection{Simpler Rules}\label{oit-eval-cat-v2}}

In order to not only consider the most ambitious fully \(V\)-optimal rule, we
define \(S\)-optimal rules as the optimal rule that considers all possible subsets
of \(V\) covariates, with card(\(S\)) \(\leq\) card(\(V\)) and \(\emptyset \in S\). In
particular, this allows us to define a Super Learner for \(d_0\) that includes
a range of estimators from very simple (e.g., statis rules) to more complex
(e.g.~full \(V\)), and let the discrete Super Learner select a simple rule when
appropriate. This allows us to consider sub-optimal rules that are easier to estimate and
potentially provide more realistic rules. Within the \passthrough{\lstinline!tmle3mopttx!} paradigm, we just need
to change the \passthrough{\lstinline!complex!} parameter to \passthrough{\lstinline!FALSE!}:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=R]

  V = c("W4", "W3", "W2", "W1"), type = "blip2",

Even though we specified all baseline covariates as the basis
for rule estimation, a simpler rule is sufficient to maximize the mean outcome.

\textbf{QUESTION:} How does the set of covariates picked by \passthrough{\lstinline!tmle3mopttx!}
compare to the baseline covariates the true rule depends on?

\hypertarget{oit-eval-cat-v3}{%
\subsection{Realistic Optimal Individual Regimes}\label{oit-eval-cat-v3}}

In addition to considering less complex rules, \passthrough{\lstinline!tmle3mopttx!} also provides an
option to estimate the mean under the realistic, or implementable, optimal
individualized treatment. It is often the case that assigning particular regime
might have the ability to fully maximize (or minimize) the desired outcome, but
due to global or practical positivity constrains, such treatment can never be
implemented in real life (or is highly unlikely). As such, specifying
\passthrough{\lstinline!realistic!} to \passthrough{\lstinline!TRUE!}, we consider possibly suboptimal treatments that optimize
the outcome in question while being supported by the data.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=R]
# initialize a tmle specification
tmle_spec_cat_realistic <- tmle3_mopttx_blip_revere(
  V = c("W4", "W3", "W2", "W1"), type = "blip2",

\textbf{QUESTION:} Referring back to the data-generating distribution, why do you

\hypertarget{missingness-and-tmle3mopttx}{%
\subsection{\texorpdfstring{Missingness and \texttt{tmle3mopttx}}{Missingness and tmle3mopttx}}\label{missingness-and-tmle3mopttx}}

In this section, we present how to use the \passthrough{\lstinline!tmle3mopttx!} package when the data is subject
to missingness in \(Y\). Let's start by add some missingness to our outcome, first.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=R]
data_missing <- data_cat_realistic

#Add some random missingless:
rr <- sample(nrow(data_missing), 100, replace = FALSE)
data_missing[rr,"Y"]<-NA

summary(data_missing$Y)
   Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max.    NA's 
   0.00    0.00    0.00    0.46    1.00    1.00     100 
\end{lstlisting}

To start, we must first add to our library --- we now also need to estimate the
missigness process as well.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=R]
delta_learner <- Lrnr_sl$new(
  learners = list(lrn_mean, lrn_glm),
  metalearner = Lrnr_nnls$new()
)

# specify outcome and treatment regressions and create learner list
learner_list <- list(Y = Q_learner, A = g_learner, B = b_learner, delta_Y=delta_learner)
\end{lstlisting}

The \passthrough{\lstinline!learner\_list!} object above specifies the role that each of the ensemble
learners we've generated is to play in computing the initial estimators needed
for building the TMLE for the parameter of interest. In particular, it makes
explicit the fact that \passthrough{\lstinline!Y!} is used in fitting the outcome regression
while \passthrough{\lstinline!A!} is used in fitting our treatment mechanism regression,
\passthrough{\lstinline!B!} for fitting the blip function, and \passthrough{\lstinline!delta\_Y!} fits the missing outcome process.

Now, with the additional estimation step associated with missingness added, we can
proceed as usual.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=R]
# initialize a tmle specification
tmle_spec_cat_miss <- tmle3_mopttx_blip_revere(
  V = c("W1", "W2", "W3", "W4"), type = "blip2",
  learners = learner_list, maximize = TRUE, complex = TRUE,
  realistic = FALSE
)
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=R]
# fit the TML estimator
fit_cat_miss <- tmle3(tmle_spec_cat_miss, data_missing, node_list, learner_list)
fit_cat_miss
\end{lstlisting}

\hypertarget{q-learning}{%
\subsection{Q-learning}\label{q-learning}}

Alternatively, we could estimate the mean under the optimal individualized
treatment using Q-learning. The optimal rule can be learned through fitting the
likelihood, and consequently estimating the optimal rule under this fit of the
likelihood \citep{Sutton1998, murphy2003}.

Below we outline how to use \passthrough{\lstinline!tmle3mopttx!} package in order to estimate the mean
under the ITR using Q-learning. As demonstrated in the previous sections, we
first need to initialize a specification for the TMLE of our parameter of
interest. As opposed to the previous section however, we will now use
\passthrough{\lstinline!tmle3\_mopttx\_Q!} instead of \passthrough{\lstinline!tmle3\_mopttx\_blip\_revere!} in order to indicate that
we want to use Q-learning instead of TMLE.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=R]
# initialize a tmle specification
tmle_spec_Q <- tmle3_mopttx_Q(maximize = TRUE)

# Define data:
tmle_task <- tmle_spec_Q$make_tmle_task(data, node_list)

# Define likelihood:
initial_likelihood <- tmle_spec_Q$make_initial_likelihood(
  tmle_task,
  learner_list
)

# Estimate the parameter:
Q_learning(tmle_spec_Q, initial_likelihood, tmle_task)[1]
\end{lstlisting}

\hypertarget{variable-importance-analysis-with-oit}{%
\section{Variable Importance Analysis with OIT}\label{variable-importance-analysis-with-oit}}

Suppose one wishes to assess the importance of each observed covariate, in
terms of maximizing (or minimizing) the population mean of an outcome under an
optimal individualized treatment regime. In particular, a covariate that
maximizes (or minimizes) the population mean outcome the most under an optimal
individualized treatment out of all other considered covariates under optimal
assignment might be considered \emph{more important} for the outcome. To put it in
context, perhaps optimal allocation of treatment 1, denoted \(A_1\), results in a
larger mean outcome than optimal allocation of another treatment 2, denoted \(A_2\).
Therefore, we would label \(A_1\) as having a higher variable importance with
regard to maximizing (or minimizing) the mean outcome under the optimal
individualized treatment.

\hypertarget{simulated-data-2}{%
\subsection{Simulated Data}\label{simulated-data-2}}

For illustration purpose, we bin baseline covariates corresponding to
the data-generating distribution \protect\hyperlink{oit-eval}{described previously}:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=R]
# bin baseline covariates to 3 categories:
data$W1<-ifelse(data$W1<quantile(data$W1)[2],1,ifelse(data$W1<quantile(data$W1)[3],2,3))

node_list <- list(
  W = c("W3", "W4", "W2"),
  A = c("W1", "A"),
  Y = "Y"
)
\end{lstlisting}

Our node list now includes \(W_1\) as treatments as well! Don't worry,
we will still properly adjust for all baseline covariates.

\hypertarget{variable-importance-using-targeted-estimation-of-the-value-of-the-itr}{%
\subsection{Variable Importance using Targeted Estimation of the value of the ITR}\label{variable-importance-using-targeted-estimation-of-the-value-of-the-itr}}

In the previous sections we have seen how to obtain a contrast between the mean
under the optimal individualized rule and the mean under the observed outcome
for a single covariate --- we are now ready to run the variable importance analysis
for all of our specified covariates. In order to run the variable importance
analysis, we first need to initialize a specification for the TMLE of our
parameter of interest as we have done before. In addition, we need to specify
the data and the corresponding list of nodes, as well as the appropriate
learners for the outcome regression, propensity score, and the blip function.
Finally, we need to specify whether we should adjust for all the other
covariates we are assessing variable importance for. We will adjust for all \(W\)s
in our analysis, and if \passthrough{\lstinline!adjust\_for\_other\_A=TRUE!}, also for all \(A\) covariates
that are not treated as exposure in the variable importance loop.

To start, we will initialize a specification for the TMLE of our parameter of
interest (called a \passthrough{\lstinline!tmle3\_Spec!} in the \passthrough{\lstinline!tlverse!} nomenclature) simply by calling
\passthrough{\lstinline!tmle3\_mopttx\_vim!}. First, we indicate the method used for learning the optimal
individualized treatment by specifying the \passthrough{\lstinline!method!} argument of
\passthrough{\lstinline!tmle3\_mopttx\_vim!}. If \passthrough{\lstinline!method="Q"!}, then we will be using Q-learning for rule
estimation, and we do not need to specify \passthrough{\lstinline!V!}, \passthrough{\lstinline!type!} and \passthrough{\lstinline!learners!} arguments
in the spec, since they are not important for Q-learning. However, if
\passthrough{\lstinline!method="SL"!}, which corresponds to learning the optimal individualized
treatment using the above outlined methodology, then we need to specify the type
of (pseudo) blip we will use in this estimation problem, whether we want to
maximize or minimize the outcome, complex and realistic rules, resource constraint.
Finally, for \passthrough{\lstinline!method="SL"!} we also need to communicate that we're interested in learning a
rule dependent on \passthrough{\lstinline!V!} covariates by specifying the \passthrough{\lstinline!V!} argument. For both
\passthrough{\lstinline!method="Q"!} and \passthrough{\lstinline!method="SL"!}, we need to indicate whether we want to maximize
or minimize the mean under the optimal individualized rule. Finally, we also
need to specify whether the final comparison of the mean under the optimal
individualized rule and the mean under the observed outcome should be on the
multiplicative scale (risk ratio) or linear (similar to average treatment
effect).

\begin{lstlisting}[language=R]
# initialize a tmle specification
tmle_spec_vim <- tmle3_mopttx_vim(
  V=c("W2"),
  type = "blip2",
  learners = learner_list,
  maximize = FALSE,
  method = "SL",
  complex = TRUE,
  realistic = FALSE
)
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=R]
# fit the TML estimator
vim_results <- tmle3_vim(tmle_spec_vim, data, node_list, learner_list,
  adjust_for_other_A = TRUE
)

print(vim_results)

\end{lstlisting}

The final result of \passthrough{\lstinline!tmle3\_vim!} with the \passthrough{\lstinline!tmle3mopttx!} spec is an ordered list
of mean outcomes under the optimal individualized treatment for all categorical
covariates in our dataset.

Finally, we cement everything we learned so far with a real data application.

As in the previous sections, we will be using the WASH Benefits data,
corresponding to the effect of water quality, sanitation, hand washing, and
nutritional interventions on child development in rural Bangladesh.

The main aim of the cluster-randomized controlled trial was to assess the
impact of six intervention groups, including:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  control;
\item
  hand-washing with soap;
\item
  improved nutrition through counseling and provision of lipid-based nutrient
  supplements;
\item
  combined water, sanitation, hand-washing, and nutrition;
\item
  improved sanitation;
\item
  combined water, sanitation, and hand-washing;
\item
  chlorinated drinking water.
\end{enumerate}

We aim to estimate the optimal ITR and the corresponding value under the optimal
ITR for the main intervention in WASH Benefits data.

Our outcome of interest is the weight-for-height Z-score, whereas our primary
treatment is the six intervention groups aimed at improving living conditions.

Questions:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Define \(V\) as mother's education (\passthrough{\lstinline!momedu!}), current living conditions (\passthrough{\lstinline!floor!}),
  and possession of material items including the refrigerator (\passthrough{\lstinline!asset\_refrig!}).
  Why do you think we use these covariates as \(V\)? Do we want to minimize or
  maximize the outcome? Which (pseudo) blip type should we use?
\item
  Load the WASH Benefits data, and define the appropriate nodes for treatment
  and outcome. Use all the rest of the covariates as \(W\) except for
  \passthrough{\lstinline!momheight!} for now. Construct an appropriate \passthrough{\lstinline!sl3!} library for \(A\), \(Y\) and
  \(B\).
\item
  Based on the \(V\) defined in the previous question, estimate the mean under
  the ITR for the main randomized intervention used in the WASH Benefits trial
  with weight-for-height Z-score as the outcome. What's the TMLE value of the
  optimal ITR? How does it change from the initial estimate? Which
  intervention is the most prominent? Why do you think that is?
\item
  Using the same formulation as in questions 1 and 2, estimate the realistic
  optimal ITR and the corresponding value of the realistic ITR. Did the results
  change? Which intervention is the most prominent under realistic rules? Why do
  you think that is?
\item
  Consider simpler rules for the WASH benefits data example. Which covariates does the
  final rule depend on?
\item
  Change the treatment to a binary variable (\passthrough{\lstinline!asset\_sewmach!}), and estimate the
  value under the ITR in this setting under a \(60\%\) resource constraint. What
  do the results indicate?
\item
  Change the treatment once again, now to mother's education (\passthrough{\lstinline!momedu!}), and
  estimate the value under the ITR in this setting. What do the results
  indicate? Can we intervene on such a variable?

\hypertarget{why-stochastic-interventions}{%
\section{\texorpdfstring{Why \emph{Stochastic} Interventions?}{Why Stochastic Interventions?}}\label{why-stochastic-interventions}}

Stochastic treatment regimes, or \emph{stochastic interventions}, constitute a
relatively simple yet extremely flexible and expressive framework for defining
\emph{realistic} causal effects. In contrast to intervention regimens discussed
previously, stochastic interventions may be applied to nearly any manner of
treatment variable -- binary, ordinal, continuous -- allowing for a rich set of
causal effects to be defined through this formalism. This chapter focuses on
examining a few types of stochastic interventions that may be applied to
\emph{continuous} treatment variables, to which static and dynamic treatment regimes
cannot easily be applied. Notably, the resultant causal effects conveniently are
endowed with an interpretation echoing that of ordinary regression adjustment.

In the next chapter, we will introduce two alternative uses of stochastic
interventions -- a recently formulated intervention applicable to binary
treatment variables \citep{kennedy2019nonparametric} and the definition of causal
effects in the presence of post-treatment, or mediating, variables. Here, we
will focus on the tools provided in the \href{https://github.com/tlverse/tmle3shift}{\passthrough{\lstinline!tmle3shift!} R
package}, which exposes targeted minimum
loss-based estimators of the causal effects of stochastic interventions that
additively shift the observed value of the treatment variable. More
comprehensive, technical presentations of some aspects of the material in this
chapter appear in \citet{diaz2012population}, \citet{diaz2018stochastic},
\citet{hejazi2020efficient}, and \citet{hejazi2021semiparametric}.

\hypertarget{data-structure-and-notation-1}{%
\section{Data Structure and Notation}\label{data-structure-and-notation-1}}

Let us return to the familiar data unit \(O = (W, A, Y)\), where \(W\) denote
baseline covariates (e.g., age, biological sex, education level), \(A\) a
treatment variable (e.g., dose of nutritional supplements), and \(Y\) an outcome
of interest (e.g., disease status). Here, we consider \(A\) that are
continuous-valued (i.e., \(A \in \R\)) or ordinal with many levels. For a given
study, we consider observing \(n\) independent and identically distributed units
\(O_1, \ldots, O_n\).

Following \protect\hyperlink{roadmap}{the roadmap}, let \(O \sim P_0 \in \M\), where \(\M\) is the
nonparametric statistical model, minimizing any restrictions on the form of the
data-generating distribution \(P_0\). To formalize the definition of stochastic
interventions and their corresponding causal effects, we introduce a structural
causal model (SCM), based on \citet{pearl2009causality}, to define how the system
changes under posited interventions:
\begin{align}
  W &= f_W(U_W) \\ \nonumber
  A &= f_A(W, U_A) \\ \nonumber
  Y &= f_Y(A, W, U_Y).
  \label{eq:npsem-shift}
\end{align}
The set of structural equations provide a mechanistic model describing the
relationships between variables composing the observed data unit \(O\). The SCM
describes a temporal ordering between the variables (i.e., that \(Y\) occurs after
\(A\), which occurs after \(W\)); specifies deterministic functions \(\{f_W, f_A, f_Y\}\) generating each variable \(\{W, A, Y\}\) based on those preceding it and
exogenous (unobserved) variable \(\{U_W, U_A, U_Y\}\); and requires that each
exogenous variable is assumed to contain all unobserved causes of the
corresponding observed variable.

We can factorize the likelihood of the data unit \(O\) as follows, revealing
orthogonal components of the density, \(p_0\), when evaluated on a typical
observation \(o\):
\begin{align}
  p_0(o) = &q_{0,Y}(y \mid A = a, W = w) \\ \nonumber
    &g_{0,A}(a \mid W = w) \\ \nonumber
    &q_{0,W}(w),\\ \nonumber
  \label{eq:likelihood-factorization-shift}
\end{align}
where \(q_{0, Y}\) is the conditional density of \(Y\) given \(\{A, W\}\) with respect
to some dominating measure, \(g_{0, A}\) is the conditional density of \(A\) given
\(W\) with respect to dominating measure \(\mu\), and \(q_{0, W}\) is the density of
\(W\) with respect to dominating measure \(\nu\). In the interest of continuing to
use familiar notation, we let \(\overline{Q}(A, W) = \E[Y \mid A, W]\), \(g(A \mid W) = g_{A}(A \mid W)\), and \(q_W\) the marginal distribution of \(W\). Importantly,
the SCM parameterizes \(p_0\) in terms of the distribution of random variables
\((O, U)\) modeled by the system of equations. In turn, this implies a model for
the distribution of counterfactual random variables generated by interventions
on the data-generating process.

\section{Defining the Causal Effect of a Stochastic Intervention}\label{defining-the-causal-effect-of-a-stochastic-intervention}}

Causal effects are defined in terms of contrasts of hypothetical interventions
on the SCM \eqref{eq:npsem-shift}. Stochastic interventions modifying
components of the SCM may be thought of in two equivalent ways. A \emph{general}
stochastic intervention replaces the equation \(f_A\), which gives rise to \(A\),
and \(g(A \mid W)\), the natural conditional density of A, with a candidate
density \(g_{A_{\delta}}(A \mid W)\). In the absence of the intervention, we would
consider any given value \(a \in \mathcal{A}\), the support of \(A\) -- that is, the
result of evaluating the function \(f_A\) at a given value \(W = w\) -- as the
result of a random draw from the distribution defined by the conditional density
\(g(A \mid W)\), that is, \(A_{\delta} \sim g_{A_{\delta}}(\cdot \mid W)\). In
applying the intervention, we simply remove the structural equation \(f_A\),
instead drawing the post-intervention value \(A_{\delta}\) from the distribution
defined by the candidate density \(g_{A_{\delta}}(A \mid W)\). The
post-intervention value \(A_{\delta}\) is stochastically modified in the sense
that it has been drawn from an arbitrary (in practice, user-defined)
distribution. Note that the familiar case of static interventions can be
recovered by choosing degenerate candidate distributions, which place all mass
on just a single value. \citet{stock1989nonparametric} first considered estimating the
total effects of such stochastic interventions.

While there are few restrictions on the choice of the candidate post-treatment
density \(g_{A_{\delta}}(A \mid W)\), in practice, it is often chosen based on
knowledge of the natural (or pre-intervention) density \(g(A \mid W)\). When
\(g_{A_{\delta}}(A \mid W)\) is \emph{piecewise smooth invertible} (more below)
\citep{haneuse2013estimation}, there is a direct correspondence between the
post-intervention density \(g_{A_{\delta}}(A \mid W)\) and a function \(d(A, W; \delta)\) that maps an observed pair \(\{A, W\}\) to the post-intervention quantity
\(A_{\delta}\). In such cases, the stochastic intervention, defined by \(d(A, W; \delta)\), is said to depend on the natural value of treatment and has been
termed a \emph{modified treatment policy} (MTP) \citep{haneuse2013estimation, diaz2018stochastic, hejazi2021semiparametric}. \citet{haneuse2013estimation} and
\citet{young2014identification} provide detailed discussions contrasting the
interpretations of the causal effects under modified treatment policies and
general stochastic interventions.

\begin{definition}[Piecewise Smooth Invertibility]
For each \(w \in \mathcal{W}\), assume that the interval \(\mathcal{I}(w) = (l(w,), u(w))\) may be partitioned into subintervals \(\mathcal{I}_{\delta,j}(w): j = 1, \ldots, J(w)\) such that \(d(a, w; \delta)\) is equal to some \(d_j(a, w; \delta)\) in \(\mathcal{I}_{\delta,j}(w)\) and \(d_j(\cdot,w; \delta)\) has inverse
function \(b_j(\cdot, w; \delta)\) with derivative \(b_j'(\cdot, w; \delta)\).
\end{definition}

A stochastic intervention gives rise to a counterfactual random variable
\(Y_{A_{\delta}} := f_Y(A_{\delta}, W, U_Y)\), where the counterfactual outcome
\(Y_{A_{\delta}} \sim \mathcal{P}_0^{A_{\delta}}\) arises from replacing the
natural value of \(A\) with \(A_{\delta}\) (whether as a draw from
\(g_{A_{\delta}}(A \mid W)\) or by evaluating \(d(A, W; \delta)\)). For the
remainder of this chapter, we will focus on additive MTPs of the form
\begin{equation}
  d(a, w; \delta) =
  \begin{cases}
    a + \delta & \text{if } a + \delta \leq u(w) \\
    a & \text{if } a + \delta > u(w),
  \end{cases}
  \label{eq:shift}
\end{equation}
where \(\delta \in \mathbb{R}\) defines the degree to which an observed \(A = a\)
ought to be shifted, in the context of the stratum \(W = w\), and \(l(w)\) and
\(u(w)\) are the minimum and maximum values of the treatment \(A\) in the stratum
\(W = w\). Consider, for example, the case where \(A\) denotes a (continuous-valued)
dosage of nutritional supplements (e.g., number of vitamin pills) and assume
that the distribution of \(A\) conditional on \(W = w\) has support in the interval
\((l(w), u(w))\). That is, the minimum number of pills taken for an individual
with in the covariate stratum defined by \(W = w\) is \(l(w)\); similarly, the
maximum is \(u(w)\). Such a stochastic intervention may be interpreted as the
result of a clinic policy encouraging individuals to consume \(\delta\) more
vitamin pills (\(A \delta\)) than they would normally be recommended (\(A\)) based
on their baseline characteristics \(W\). This class of stochastic interventions
was introduced by \citet{diaz2012population} and has been further discussed in
\citet{haneuse2013estimation}, \citet{diaz2018stochastic}, \citet{hejazi2020efficient}, and
\citet{hejazi2021semiparametric}. This class of interventions may be expressed as a
general stochastic intervention, as per \citet{diaz2012population}, by considering the
random draw \(\P_{A_{\delta}}(g_{0, A})(A = a \mid W) = g_{0,A}(a - \delta(W) \mid W)\).

In order to evaluate the causal effect of our intervention, we consider as a
parameter of interest the counterfactual mean of the outcome under our
stochastically modified intervention distribution. This target causal estimand
is \(\psi_{0, \delta} \coloneqq \E_{P_0^{A_{\delta}}}\{Y_{A_{\delta}}\}\), the
mean of the counterfactual outcome variable \(Y_{A_{\delta}}\).
\citet{diaz2018stochastic} showed that \(\psi_{0, \delta}\) may be identified by a
functional of the distribution of \(O\):
\begin{align}
  \psi_{0,\delta} = \int_{\mathcal{W}} \int_{\mathcal{A}} & \E_{P_0}
   \{Y \mid A = d(a, w), W = w\} \nonumber \\ &q_{0, A}(a \mid W = w)
   q_{0, W}(w) d\mu(a)d\nu(w).
  \label{eq:identification2012}
\end{align}
Under certain identification conditions, which we will enumerate shortly, the
statistical parameter in Equation \eqref{eq:identification2012} matches exactly
the counterfactual mean \(\psi_{0, \delta}\). While this book is not concerned
with the identification of causal parameters -- that is, establishing
statistical functionals of the observed data that have causal interpretations
under certain assumptions -- we review key assumptions for identifying the
counterfactual mean \(\psi_{0, \delta}\) below. As the SCM introduced prior
generates independent and identically distributed units \(O\), the common
identification assumptions of consistency (\(Y^{A_{\delta,i}}_i = Y_i\) in the
event \(A_i = d(a_i, w_i)\), for \(i = 1, \ldots, n\)) and lack of interference
(\(Y^{A_{\delta,i}}_i\) does not depend on \(d(a_j, w_j)\) for \(i = 1, \ldots, n\)
and \(j \neq i\)) hold. Beyond these, we require no unmeasured confounding (the
analog to the randomization assumption in observational studies) and positivity.

\begin{definition}[No Unmeasured Confounding]
\(A_i \indep Y^{A_{\delta,i}}_i \mid W_i\), for \(i = 1, \ldots, n\). This is the
observational study analog to the well-known randomization assumption.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Treatment Positivity]
\(a_i \in \mathcal{A} \implies d(a_i, w_i) \in \mathcal{A}\) for all \(w \in \mathcal{W}\), where \(\mathcal{A}\) denotes the support of \(A \mid W = w_i \quad \forall i = 1, \ldots n\).
\end{definition}

\section{Estimating the Causal Effect of a Stochastic Intervention}\label{estimating-the-causal-effect-of-a-stochastic-intervention}}

\citet{diaz2012population} provided a derivation of the efficient influence function
(EIF), a key quantity for constructing efficient estimators, in the
nonparametric model \(\M\) and developed both classical and efficient estimators
of this quantity, including substitution, inverse probability weighted, one-step
and targeted maximum likelihood (TML) estimators. Both the one-step and TML
estimators allow for semiparametric-efficient estimation and inference on the
target quantity of interest \(\psi_{0, \delta}\). As described by
\citet{diaz2018stochastic}, the EIF of \(\psi_{0, \delta}\), with respect to the
nonparametric model \(\M\), is
\begin{equation}
  D(P_0)(x) = H(a, w)({y - \overline{Q}(a, w)}) +
  \overline{Q}(d(a, w), w) - \Psi(P_0),
  \label{eq:eif-shift}
\end{equation}
where the auxiliary covariate \(H(a,w)\) may be expressed
\begin{equation}
  H(a,w) = \mathbb{I}(a + \delta < u(w)) \frac{g_0(a - \delta \mid w)}
  {g_0(a \mid w)} + \mathbb{I}(a + \delta \geq u(w)),
  \label{eq:aux-covar-full-shift}
\end{equation}
which may be reduced to
\begin{equation}
  H(a,w) = \frac{g_0(a - \delta \mid w)}{g_0(a \mid w)} + 1
  \label{eq:aux-covar-simple-shift}
\end{equation}
when the treatment \(A\) lies within the limits defined by the covariate strata
\(W\), that is, for \(A_i \in (u(w) - \delta, u(w))\). The efficient influence
function is a key ingredient in the construction of semiparametric-efficient
estimators. Next, we focus on a targeted maximum likelihood (TML) estimator, for
which \citet{diaz2018stochastic} give the following recipe:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Construct initial estimators \(g_n\) of \(g_0(A, W)\) and \(\overline{Q}_n\) of
  \(\overline{Q}_0(A, W)\), ideally using data-adaptive regression techniques.
\item
  For each observation \(i\), compute an estimate \(H_n(a_i, w_i)\) of the
  auxiliary covariate \(H(a_i,w_i)\).
\item
  Construct the one-dimensional logistic regression model,
  \[ \text{logit}\overline{Q}_{\epsilon, n}(a, w) =
  \text{logit}\overline{Q}_n(a, w) + \epsilon H_n(a, w),\]
  or an analogous regression model incorporating \(H_n\) as weights. Estimate the
  regression model's parameter \(\epsilon\), obtaining \(\epsilon_n\). The outcome
  of this regression model yields \(\overline{Q}_n^{\star}\).
\item
  Compute TML estimator \(\Psi_n\) of the target parameter, defining update
  \(\overline{Q}_n^{\star}\) of the initial estimate
  \(\overline{Q}_{n, \epsilon_n}\):
  \begin{equation}
    \psi_n = \Psi(P_n^{\star}) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i = 1}^n
    \overline{Q}_n^{\star}(d(A_i, W_i), W_i).
    \label{eq:tmle}
  \end{equation}
\end{enumerate}

As \protect\hyperlink{tmle3}{discussed previously}, TML estimators are constructed so as to be
\emph{asymptotically linear} and are usually \emph{doubly robust}. Asymptotic linearity
means that the asymptotic difference between the estimator \(\psi_n\) and the
target parameter \(\psi_0\) can be expressed in terms of the EIF, that is,
\begin{equation}
  \sqrt{n}(\psi_n - \psi_0) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}\sum_{i=1}^n D(P_0)(O_i) +
    o_p(1).
  \label{eq:asymplin-shift}
\end{equation}
Together with regularity, asymptotic linearity establishes a class of estimators
whose asymptotic variance is bounded from below by the asymptotic variance of
the EIF. This means that such estimators are solutions to the EIF estimating
equation (i.e., plugging the TML estimator \(\psi_n\) into the EIF equation
results in a solution close to zero) and that their sampling variance may be
approximated by the variance of the EIF in closed form. This latter fact is
computationally convenient, as resampling methods (e.g., the bootstrap) are not
strictly necessary for variance estimation. A central limit theorem establishes
that the asymptotic distribution of the estimator \(\psi_n\) is centered at
\(\psi_0\) and is Gaussian:
\begin{equation}
  \sqrt{n}(\psi_n - \psi_0) \to \text{Normal}(0, \sigma^2(D(P_0))).
  \label{eq:tmle-gaussian-shift}
\end{equation}
Thus, an estimate \(\sigma_n^2\) of the variance \(\sigma^2(D(P_0))\) may be
computed
\begin{equation}
  \sigma_n^2 = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i = 1}^{n} D^2(\overline{Q}_n^{\star},
  g_n)(O_i),
  \label{eq:eif-var-shift}
\end{equation}
allowing for Wald-style confidence intervals at coverage level \((1 - \alpha)\) to
be computed as \(\psi_n \pm z_{(1 - \alpha/2)} \cdot \sigma_n / \sqrt{n}\). Under
certain conditions, the resampling based on the bootstrap may also be used to
compute \(\sigma_n^2\) \citep{vdl2011targeted}.

\hypertarget{evaluating-the-causal-effect-of-a-stochastic-intervention}{%
\section{Evaluating the Causal Effect of a Stochastic Intervention}\label{evaluating-the-causal-effect-of-a-stochastic-intervention}}

To start, let's load the packages we'll be using throughout our simple data example

\begin{lstlisting}[language=R]
library(data.table)
library(haldensify)
library(sl3)
library(tmle3)
library(tmle3shift)
\end{lstlisting}

We need to estimate two components of the likelihood in order to construct a TML
estimator. The first of these components is the outcome regression,
\(\overline{Q}_n\), which is a simple regression of the form \(\E[Y \mid A,W]\). An
estimate for such a quantity may be constructed using the Super Learner
algorithm. We construct the components of an \passthrough{\lstinline!sl3!}-style Super Learner for a
regression below, using a small variety of parametric and nonparametric
regression techniques:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=R]
# learners used for conditional mean of the outcome
mean_lrnr <- Lrnr_mean$new()
fglm_lrnr <- Lrnr_glm_fast$new()
rf_lrnr <- Lrnr_ranger$new()
hal_lrnr <- Lrnr_hal9001$new(max_degree = 3, n_folds = 3)

# SL for the outcome regression
sl_reg_lrnr <- Lrnr_sl$new(
  learners = list(mean_lrnr, fglm_lrnr, rf_lrnr, hal_lrnr),
  metalearner = Lrnr_nnls$new()
)
\end{lstlisting}

The second of these is an estimate of the treatment mechanism, \(g_n\), i.e., the
\emph{generalized propensity score}. In the case of a continuous intervention node
\(A\), such a quantity takes the form \(p(A \mid W)\), which is a conditional
density. Generally speaking, conditional density estimation is a challenging
problem that has received much attention in the literature. To estimate the
treatment mechanism, we must make use of learning algorithms specifically suited
to conditional density estimation; a list of such learners may be extracted from
\passthrough{\lstinline!sl3!} by using \passthrough{\lstinline!sl3\_list\_learners()!}:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=R]
sl3_list_learners("density")
[1] "Lrnr_density_discretize"     "Lrnr_density_hse"           
[3] "Lrnr_density_semiparametric" "Lrnr_haldensify"            
[5] "Lrnr_solnp_density"         
\end{lstlisting}

To proceed, we'll select two of the above learners, \passthrough{\lstinline!Lrnr\_haldensify!} for using
the highly adaptive lasso for conditional density estimation, based on an
algorithm given by \citet{diaz2011super} and implemented in \citet{hejazi2020haldensify}, and
semiparametric location-scale conditional density estimators implemented in the
\href{https://github.com/tlverse/sl3}{\passthrough{\lstinline!sl3!} package}. A Super Learner may be
constructed by pooling estimates from each of these modified conditional density
regression techniques (note that we exclude the approach based on the
\passthrough{\lstinline!haldensify!} learner from our Super Learner on account of the computationally
intensive nature of the approach).

\begin{lstlisting}[language=R]
# learners used for conditional densities for (g_n)
haldensify_lrnr <- Lrnr_haldensify$new(
  n_bins = c(5, 10, 20),
  lambda_seq = exp(seq(-1, -10, length = 200))
)
# semiparametric density estimator with homoscedastic errors (HOSE)
hose_hal_lrnr <- make_learner(Lrnr_density_semiparametric,
  mean_learner = hal_lrnr
)
# semiparametric density estimator with heteroscedastic errors (HESE)
hese_rf_glm_lrnr <- make_learner(Lrnr_density_semiparametric,
  mean_learner = rf_lrnr,
  var_learner = fglm_lrnr
)

# SL for the conditional treatment density
sl_dens_lrnr <- Lrnr_sl$new(
  learners = list(hose_hal_lrnr, hese_rf_glm_lrnr),
  metalearner = Lrnr_solnp_density$new()
)
\end{lstlisting}

Finally, we construct a \passthrough{\lstinline!learner\_list!} object for use in constructing a TML
estimator of our target parameter of interest:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=R]
learner_list <- list(Y = sl_reg_lrnr, A = sl_dens_lrnr)
\end{lstlisting}

The \passthrough{\lstinline!learner\_list!} object above specifies the role that each of the ensemble
learners we have generated is to play in computing initial estimators to be
used in building a TMLE for the parameter of interest here. In particular, it
makes explicit the fact that our \passthrough{\lstinline!Q\_learner!} is used in fitting the outcome
regression while our \passthrough{\lstinline!g\_learner!} is used in estimating the treatment mechanism.

\hypertarget{example-with-simulated-data}{%
\subsection{Example with Simulated Data}\label{example-with-simulated-data}}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=R]
# simulate simple data for tmle-shift sketch
n_obs <- 400 # number of observations
tx_mult <- 2 # multiplier for the effect of W = 1 on the treatment

## baseline covariates -- simple, binary
W <- replicate(2, rbinom(n_obs, 1, 0.5))

## create treatment based on baseline W
A <- rnorm(n_obs, mean = tx_mult * W, sd = 1)

## create outcome as a linear function of A, W + white noise
Y <- rbinom(n_obs, 1, prob = plogis(A + W))

# organize data and nodes for tmle3
data <- data.table(W, A, Y)
setnames(data, c("W1", "W2", "A", "Y"))
node_list <- list(
  W = c("W1", "W2"),
  A = "A",
  Y = "Y"
)
head(data)
   W1 W2        A Y
1:  1  1  0.27165 1
2:  0  0 -0.66337 1
3:  0  0  0.11337 0
4:  0  1 -0.73256 0
5:  1  1  0.38884 1
6:  0  0  0.04399 0
\end{lstlisting}

The above composes our observed data structure \(O = (W, A, Y)\). To formally
express this fact using the \passthrough{\lstinline!tlverse!} grammar introduced by the \passthrough{\lstinline!tmle3!} package,
we create a single data object and specify the functional relationships between
the nodes in the \emph{directed acyclic graph} (DAG) via an SCM, reflected in the
node list we set up.

We now have an observed data structure (\passthrough{\lstinline!data!}) and a specification of the role
that each variable in the data set plays as the nodes in a DAG.

To start, we will initialize a specification for the TMLE of our parameter of
interest (called a \passthrough{\lstinline!tmle3\_Spec!} in the \passthrough{\lstinline!tlverse!} nomenclature) simply by calling
\passthrough{\lstinline!tmle\_shift!}. We specify the argument \passthrough{\lstinline!shift\_val = 0.5!} when initializing the
\passthrough{\lstinline!tmle3\_Spec!} object to communicate that we're interested in a shift of \(0.5\) on
the scale of the treatment \(A\) -- that is, we specify \(\delta = 0.5\) (an
arbitrarily chosen value for this example).

\begin{lstlisting}[language=R]
# initialize a tmle specification
tmle_spec <- tmle_shift(
  shift_val = 0.5,
  shift_fxn = shift_additive,
  shift_fxn_inv = shift_additive_inv
)
\end{lstlisting}

As seen above, the \passthrough{\lstinline!tmle\_shift!} specification object (like all \passthrough{\lstinline!tmle3\_Spec!}
objects) does \emph{not} store the data for our specific analysis of interest. Later,
we'll see that passing a data object directly to the \passthrough{\lstinline!tmle3!} wrapper function,
alongside the instantiated \passthrough{\lstinline!tmle\_spec!}, will serve to construct a \passthrough{\lstinline!tmle3\_Task!}
object internally (see the \passthrough{\lstinline!tmle3!} documentation for details).

\hypertarget{selecting-stable-stochastic-interventions}{%
\section{Selecting Stable Stochastic Interventions}\label{selecting-stable-stochastic-interventions}}

At times, a particular choice of the shift parameter \(\delta\) may lead to
positivity violations and downstream instability in the estimation process. In
order to curb such issues, we can make choices of \(\delta\) based on the impact
of the candidate values on the estimator. Recall that a simplified expression of
the auxiliary covariate for the TMLE of \(\psi\) is \(H = \frac{g(a - \delta \mid w)}{g(a \mid w)}\), where \(g(a - \delta \mid w)\) is defined by the stochastic
intervention of interest. We can design our stochastic intervention to avoid
violations of the positivity assumption by by considering a bound \(C(\delta) = \frac{g(a - \delta \mid w)}{g(a \mid w)} < M\), where \(M\) is a potentially
user-specified upper bound of \(C(\delta)\). Note that \(C(\delta)\) corresponds to
the inverse weight assigned to the unit with counterfactual treatment value \(A = a + \delta\), natural treatment value \(A = a\), and covariates \(W = w\). So,
\(C(\delta)\) can be viewed as a measure of the influence that a given observation
has on the estimator \(\psi_n\). By limiting \(C(\delta)\), whether through a choice
of \(M\) or \(\delta\), we can limit the potential instability of our estimator. We
can formalize this procedure by defining a new shift function \(\delta(A, W)\):
\begin{equation}
  \delta(a, w) =
    \begin{cases}
      \delta, & \delta_{\text{min}}(a,w) \leq \delta \leq
        \delta_{\text{max}}(a,w) \\
      \delta_{\text{max}}(a,w), & \delta \geq \delta_{\text{max}}(a,w) \\
      \delta_{\text{min}}(a,w), & \delta \leq \delta_{\text{min}}(a,w) \\
    \end{cases},
    \label{eq:delta-min-max-shift}
\end{equation}
where \[\delta_{\text{max}}(a, w) = \text{argmax}_{\left\{\delta \geq 0,
\frac{g(a - \delta \mid w)}{g(a \mid w)} \leq M \right\}} \frac{g(a - \delta
\mid w)}{g(a \mid w)}\] and
\[\delta_{\text{min}}(a, w) = \text{argmin}_{\left\{\delta \leq 0,
\frac{g(a - \delta \mid w)}{g(a \mid w)} \leq M \right\}} \frac{g(a - \delta
\mid w)}{g(a \mid w)}.\]

The above provides a strategy for implementing a shift at the level of a given
observation \((a_i, w_i)\), thereby allowing for all observations to be shifted to
an appropriate value, whether \(\delta_{\text{min}}\), \(\delta\), or
\(\delta_{\text{max}}\). The \href{https://github.com/tlverse/tmle3shift}{\passthrough{\lstinline!tmle3shift!}}
package implements the functions \passthrough{\lstinline!shift\_additive\_bounded!} and
\passthrough{\lstinline!shift\_additive\_bounded\_inv!}, which define a variation of this strategy:
\begin{equation}
  \delta(a, w) =
    \begin{cases}
      \delta, & C(\delta) \leq M \\
      0, \text{otherwise} \\
    \end{cases},
  \label{eq:shift-bounded-simple}
\end{equation}
corresponding to an intervention in which the natural value of treatment \(A = a\)
is shifted by a value \(\delta\) when the ratio \(C(\delta)\) of the
post-intervention density \(g(a - \delta \mid w)\) to the natural treatment
density \(g(a \mid w)\) does not exceed a bound \(M\). When \(C(\delta)\) exceeds the
bound \(M\), the stochastic intervention exempts the given unit from the treatment
modification, leaving them to their natural value of treatment \(A = a\).

To start, we will initialize a specification for the TMLE of our parameter of
interest (called a \passthrough{\lstinline!tmle3\_Spec!} in the \passthrough{\lstinline!tlverse!} nomenclature) simply by calling
\passthrough{\lstinline!tmle\_shift!}. We specify the argument \passthrough{\lstinline!shift\_grid = seq(-1, 1, by = 1)!}
when initializing the \passthrough{\lstinline!tmle3\_Spec!} object to communicate that we're interested
in assessing the mean counterfactual outcome over a grid of shifts \(\delta \in \{-1, 0, 1\}\) on the scale of the treatment \(A\) (n.b., we make an arbitrary
choice of shift values for this example).

\begin{lstlisting}[language=R]
# what's the grid of shifts we wish to consider?
delta_grid <- seq(-1, 1, 1)

# initialize a tmle specification
tmle_spec <- tmle_vimshift_delta(
  shift_grid = delta_grid,
  max_shifted_ratio = 2
)
\end{lstlisting}

As seen above, the \passthrough{\lstinline!tmle\_vimshift!} specification object (like all \passthrough{\lstinline!tmle3\_Spec!}
objects) does \emph{not} store the data for our specific analysis of interest. Later,
we'll see that passing a data object directly to the \passthrough{\lstinline!tmle3!} wrapper function,
alongside the instantiated \passthrough{\lstinline!tmle\_spec!}, will serve to construct a \passthrough{\lstinline!tmle3\_Task!}
object internally (see the \passthrough{\lstinline!tmle3!} documentation for details).

\subsection{Estimation and Inference with Marginal Structural Models}\label{estimation-and-inference-with-marginal-structural-models}}

It can be challenging to select a value of the shift parameter \(\delta\) in
advance. One solution is to specify a \emph{grid} of such shifts \(\delta\) to be used
in defining a set of related stochastic interventions \citep{hejazi2020efficient}.
When we consider estimating the counterfactual mean \(\psi_n\) under several
choices of \(\delta\), a single summary measure of these estimated quantities can
be established through working marginal structural models (MSMs). Summarizing
the estimates \(\psi_n\) through a working MSM allows for inference on the \emph{trend}
appearing through the grid in \(\delta\), which may be evaluating through a simple
hypothesis test on the slope parameter \(\beta_0\) of the working MSM. Consider a
grid of \(\delta\), \(\{\delta_1, \ldots, \delta_k\}\), corresponding to
counterfactual means \(\{\psi_{\delta_1}, \ldots, \psi_{\delta_k}\}\). Next, let
\(\psi(\delta) = (\psi_{\delta}: \delta)\) denote the grid of
counterfactual means in the grid defined by \(\delta\) and let \(\psi_n(\delta)\)
denote TML estimators of \(\psi(\delta)\). The MSM summarizing the change in
\(\psi_n\) as a function of \(\delta\) may be expressed \(m_{\beta}(\psi_{\delta}) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \delta\). This simple working model summarizes the changes in
\(\psi_{\delta}\) as a function of the parameters \((\beta_0, \beta_1)\), where the
latter is the slope of the line resulting from projecting the counterfactual
means onto this simple two-parameter working model.

A more general expression for the MSM \(m_{\beta}(\delta)\) is \(\beta_0 = \text{argmin}_{\beta} \sum_{\delta}(\psi_{\delta}(P_0) - m_{\beta}(\delta))^2 h(\delta)\), the solution to the estimating equation
\[u(\beta, (\psi_{\delta}: \delta)) = \sum_{\delta}h(\delta)
\left(\psi_{\delta}(P_0) - m_{\beta}(\delta) \right) \frac{d}{d\beta}
m_{\beta}(\delta) = 0.\]
Now, say, \(\psi = (\psi(\delta): \delta)\) is d-dimensional. We may express the
EIF of the MSM parameter \(\beta_0\) in terms of the EIFs of the individual
counterfactual means:
\begin{align}
   D_{\beta}(O) = &\left(\sum_{\delta} h(\delta) \frac{d}{d\beta}
   m_{\beta}(\delta) \frac{d}{d\beta} m_{\beta}(\delta)^t \right)^{-1}
   \\ \nonumber
   &\sum_{\delta} h(\delta) \frac{d}{d\beta} m_{\beta}(\delta)
   D_{\psi_{\delta}}(O).
   \label{eq:eif-msm-shift}
\end{align}
Here, in Equation \eqref{eq:eif-msm-shift}, the first component is of dimension
\(d \times d\) and the second is of dimension \(d \times 1\). In the above, we
assume a linear working MSM; however, an analogous procedure may be applied for
working MSMs based on GLMs.

Above, we utilized a straightforward application of the delta method to obtain
the EIF of \(\beta\). Inference for this parameter of a working MSM follows from
evaluation of its EIF \(D_{\beta}\), which is expressed in terms of the EIFs of
each of the corresponding estimates \(\psi_n(\delta)\). The limit distribution of
\(\beta_n\) may be expressed \[\sqrt{n}(\beta_n - \beta_0) \to N(0, \Sigma),\]
where \(\Sigma\) is the empirical covariance matrix of \(D_{\beta}(O)\). With this,
we can not only estimate the trend through the counterfactual means across a
grid in \(\delta\), but we can also evaluate whether the slope estimate is
statistically significant, in terms of hypothesis tests of the form \((H_0: \beta_0 = 0; H_1: \beta_0 \neq 0)\) and equivalent Wald-style confidence
intervals. Note that the estimator \(\beta_n\) of the parameter \(\beta_0\) of the
MSM is asymptotically linear (and, in fact, a TML estimator) as a consequence of
its construction from individual TML estimators.

The strategy just discussed constructs an estimate \(\beta_n\) of the working MSM
slope \(\beta_0\) by first evaluating the TML estimates of the counterfactual
means \(\psi_{n,\delta}\) in the grid \(\{\delta_1, \ldots, \delta_k\}\); however,
this is not necessarily the best strategy, especially when giving consideration
to estimation stability in small samples. In smaller samples, it may be prudent
to perform TML estimation targeting directly the parameter \(\beta_0\), as opposed
to constructing it by applying the delta method to several independently
targeted TML estimates.

To do so, consider a TML estimator targeting \(\beta_0\) (the parameter of the
working MSM \(m_{\beta}\)), which uses a targeting update step of the form
\(\overline{Q}_{n, \epsilon}(A,W) = \overline{Q}_n(A,W) + \epsilon (H_{\beta_0}(g), H_{\beta_1}(g))\), for all \(\delta\), where \(H_{\beta_0}(g)\) is
the auxiliary covariate for \(\beta_0\) (the intercept) and \(H_{\beta}(g)\) is the
auxiliary covariate for \(\beta_1\) (the slope). Note that the forms of these
auxiliary covariates depend on the EIF \(D_{\beta}\). Such a TML estimator avoids
estimating each of the \(\psi_{\delta}\) in the grid directly, instead cleverly
concatenating their auxiliary covariates into those appropriate for \(\beta_0\)
and \(\beta_1\). To construct a targeted maximum likelihood estimator that
directly targets the parameters of the working MSM, we may use the
\passthrough{\lstinline!tmle\_vimshift\_msm!} Spec (instead of the \passthrough{\lstinline!tmle\_vimshift\_delta!} Spec).

\begin{lstlisting}[language=R]
# initialize a tmle specification
tmle_msm_spec <- tmle_vimshift_msm(
  shift_grid = delta_grid,
  max_shifted_ratio = 2
)

# fit the TML estimator and examine the results
tmle_msm_fit <- tmle3(tmle_msm_spec, data, node_list, learner_list)

washb_data <- fread(

3:             0            1
\end{lstlisting}

Next, we specify our NPSEM via the \passthrough{\lstinline!node\_list!} object. For our example analysis,
we'll consider the outcome to be the weight-for-height Z-score (as in previous
chapters), the intervention of interest to be the mother's age at time of
child's birth, and take all other covariates to be potential confounders.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=R]
node_list <- list(
  W = names(washb_data)[!(names(washb_data) %in%
    c("whz", "momage"))],
  A = "momage",
  Y = "whz"
)
\end{lstlisting}

Were we to consider the counterfactual weight-for-height Z-score under shifts in
the age of the mother at child's birth, how would we interpret estimates of our
parameter? To simplify our interpretation, consider a shift of just a year in
the mother's age (i.e., \(\delta = 1\)); in this setting, a stochastic
intervention would correspond to a policy advocating that potential mothers
defer having a child for a single calendar year, possibly implemented through an
encouragement design deployed in a clinical setting.

For this example, we'll use the variable importance strategy of considering a
grid of stochastic interventions to evaluate the weight-for-height Z-score under
a shift in the mother's age down by two years (\(\delta = -2\)) or up by two years
(\(\delta = 2\)). To do this, we simply initialize a \passthrough{\lstinline!Spec!} \passthrough{\lstinline!tmle\_vimshift\_delta!}
just as we did in a previous example:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=R]
# initialize a tmle specification for the variable importance parameter
washb_vim_spec <- tmle_vimshift_delta(
  shift_grid = c(-2, 2),
  max_shifted_ratio = 2
)
\end{lstlisting}

Prior to running our analysis, we'll modify the \passthrough{\lstinline!learner\_list!} object we had
created such that the density estimation procedure we rely on will be only the
location-scale conditional density estimation procedure, as the nonparametric
conditional density approach based on the highly adaptive lasso \citep{diaz2011super, benkeser2016hal, coyle2020hal9001, hejazi2020hal9001, hejazi2020haldensify}
is currently unable to accommodate larger datasets.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=R]
# we need to turn on cross-validation for the HOSE learner
cv_hose_hal_lrnr <- Lrnr_cv$new(
  learner = hose_hal_lrnr,
  full_fit = TRUE
)

# modify learner list, using existing SL for Q fit
learner_list <- list(Y = sl_reg_lrnr, A = cv_hose_hal_lrnr)
\end{lstlisting}

Having made the above preparations, we're now ready to estimate the
counterfactual mean of the weight-for-height Z-score under a small grid of
shifts in the mother's age at child's birth. Just as before, we do this through
a simple call to our \passthrough{\lstinline!tmle3!} wrapper function:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=R]
washb_tmle_fit <- tmle3(washb_vim_spec, washb_data, node_list, learner_list)
washb_tmle_fit

\section{Causal Mediation Analysis}\label{causal-mediation-analysis-1}}

In applications ranging from biology and epidemiology to economics and
psychology, scientific inquires are often concerned with ascertaining the effect
of a treatment on an outcome variable only through particular pathways between
the two. In the presence of post-treatment intermediate variables affected by
exposure (that is, \emph{mediators}), path-specific effects allow for such complex,
mechanistic relationships to be teased apart. These causal effects are of such
wide interest that their definition and identification has been the object of
study in statistics for nearly a century -- indeed, the earliest examples of
modern causal mediation analysis can be traced back to work on path analysis
\citep{wright1934method}. In recent decades, renewed interest has resulted in the
formulation of novel direct and indirect effects within both the potential
outcomes and nonparametric structural equation modeling frameworks
\citep{robins1986new, pearl1995causal, pearl2009causality, spirtes2000causation, dawid2000causal}. Generally, the indirect effect (IE) is the portion of the
total effect found to work \emph{through} mediating variables, while the direct
effect (DE) encompasses \emph{all other components} of the total effect, including
both the effect of the treatment directly on the outcome \emph{and} its effect
through all paths not explicitly involving the mediators. The mechanistic
knowledge conveyed by the direct and indirect effects can be used to improve
understanding of both \emph{why} and \emph{how} treatments may be efficacious.

Modern approaches to causal inference have allowed for significant advances over
the methodology of traditional path analysis, overcoming significant
restrictions imposed by the use of parametric modeling approaches
\citep{vanderweele2015explanation}. Using distinct frameworks,
\citet{robins1992identifiability} and \citet{pearl2001direct} provided equivalent
nonparametric decompositions of the average treatment effect into the \emph{natural}
direct and indirect effects. \citet{vanderweele2015explanation} provides a
comprehensive overview of classical causal mediation analysis. We provide an
alternative perspective, focusing instead on the construction of efficient
estimators of these quantities, which have appeared only recently
\citep{tchetgen2012semiparametric, zheng2012targeted}, as well as on more flexible
direct and indirect definitions based upon stochastic interventions
\citep{diaz2020causal}.

\hypertarget{data-structure-and-notation-2}{%
\section{Data Structure and Notation}\label{data-structure-and-notation-2}}

Let us return to our familiar sample of \(n\) units \(O_1, \ldots, O_n\), where we
now consider a slightly more complex data structure \(O = (W, A, Z, Y)\) for any
given observational unit. As before, \(W\) represents a vector of observed
covariates, \(A\) a binary or continuous treatment, and \(Y\) a binary or continuous
outcome; the new post-treatment variable \(Z\) represents a (possibly
multivariate) set of mediators. Avoiding assumptions unsupported by background
scientific knowledge, we assume only that \(O \sim P_0 \in \M\), where \(\M\) is the
nonparametric statistical model that places no assumptions on the form of the
data-generating distribution \(P_0\).

As in preceding chapters, a structural causal model (SCM) \citep{pearl2009causality}
helps to formalize the definition of our counterfactual variables:
\begin{align}
  W &= f_W(U_W) \\ \nonumber
  A &= f_A(W, U_A) \\ \nonumber
  Z &= f_Z(W, A, U_Z) \\ \nonumber
  Y &= f_Y(W, A, Z, U_Y).
  \label{eq:npsem-mediate}
\end{align}
This set of equations
constitutes a mechanistic model generating the observed data \(O\); furthermore,
the SCM encodes several fundamental assumptions. Firstly, there is an implicit
temporal ordering: \(W\) occurs first, depending only on exogenous factors \(U_W\);
\(A\) happens next, based on both \(W\) and exogenous factors \(U_A\); then come the
mediators \(Z\), which depend on \(A\), \(W\), and another set of exogenous factors
\(U_Z\); and finally appears the outcome \(Y\). We assume neither access to the set
of exogenous factors \(\{U_W, U_A, U_Z, U_Y\}\) nor knowledge of the forms of the
deterministic generating functions \(\{f_W, f_A, f_Z, f_Y\}\). In practice, any
available knowledge about the data-generating experiment should be incorporated
into this model -- for example, if the data from a randomized controlled trial
(RCT), the form of \(f_A\) may be known. The SCM corresponds to the following DAG:

\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=0.6\linewidth]{10-tmle3mediate_files/figure-latex/mediation-DAG-1} \end{center}

By factorizing the likelihood of the data \(O\), we can express \(p_0\), the
density of \(O\) with respect to the product measure, when evaluated on a
particular observation \(o\), in terms of several orthogonal components:
\begin{align}
  p_0(o) = &q_{0,Y}(y \mid Z = z, A = a, W = w) \\ \nonumber
    &q_{0,Z}(z \mid A = a, W = w) \\ \nonumber
    &g_{0,A}(a \mid W = w) \\ \nonumber
    &q_{0,W}(w).\\ \nonumber
  \label{eq:likelihood-factorization-mediate}
\end{align}
In Equation \eqref{eq:likelihood-factorization-mediate}, \(q_{0, Y}\) is the
conditional density of \(Y\) given \(\{Z, A, W\}\), \(q_{0, Z}\) is the conditional
density of \(Z\) given \(\{A, W\}\), \(g_{0, A}\) is the conditional density of \(A\)
given \(W\), and \(q_{0, W}\) is the marginal density of \(W\). For convenience and
consistency of notation, we will define \(\overline{Q}_Y(Z, A, W) := \E[Y \mid Z, A, W]\) and \(g(A \mid W) := \P(A \mid W)\) (i.e., the propensity score).

We have explicitly excluded potential confounders of the mediator-outcome
relationship affected by exposure (i.e., variables affected by \(A\) and affecting
both \(Z\) and \(Y\)). Mediation analysis in the presence of such variables is
challenging \citep{avin2005identifiability}; thus, most efforts to develop
definitions of causal direct and indirect effects explicitly assume the absence
of such confounders. Without further assumptions, common mediation parameters
(the natural direct and indirect effects) cannot be identified in the presence
of such confounding, though \citet{tchetgen2014identification} discuss a monotonicity
assumption that may be useful when justified by available scientific knowledge
about the system under study. The interested reader may wish to consult recent
advances in the vast and quickly growing literature on causal mediation
analysis, including \emph{interventional} direct and indirect effects
\citep{didelez2006direct, vanderweele2014effect, lok2016defining, vansteelandt2017interventional, rudolph2017robust, nguyen2019clarifying},
whose identification is robust to this complex form of post-treatment
confounding. Within this thread of the literature, \citet{diaz2020nonparametric} and
\citet{benkeser2020nonparametric} provide considerations of nonparametric effect
decompositions and efficiency theory, while \citet{hejazi2021nonparametric} formulate a
novel class of effects utilizing stochastic interventions.

\subsection{Decomposing the Average Treatment Effect}\label{decomposing-the-average-treatment-effect}}

The natural direct and indirect effects arise from a decomposition of the ATE:
\begin{align*}
  \E[Y(1) - Y(0)] =
    &\underbrace{\E[Y(1, Z(0)) - Y(0, Z(0))]}_{\text{NDE}} \\ &+
    \underbrace{\E[Y(1, Z(1)) - Y(1, Z(0))]}_{\text{NIE}}.
\end{align*}
In particular, the natural indirect effect (NIE) measures the effect of the
treatment \(A \in \{0, 1\}\) on the outcome \(Y\) through the mediators \(Z\), while
the natural direct effect (NDE) measures the effect of the treatment on the
outcome \emph{through all other pathways}. Identification of the natural direct and
indirect effects requires the following non-testable causal assumptions. Note
that the standard assumptions of consistency and no interference (i.e., SUTVA
\citep{rubin1978bayesian, rubin1980randomization}) hold owing to the fact that (1)
the SCM we consider is restricted so as to give rise only to independent and
identically distributed (iid) units; and (2) consistency is an implied property
of the SCM, as counterfactuals are derived quantities (as opposed to primitive
quantities in the potential outcomes framework); \citet{pearl2010brief} provides an
illuminating discussion on this latter point.

\begin{definition}[Exchangeability]
\(Y(a, z) \indep (A, Z) \mid W\), which further implies that \(\E\{Y(a, z) \mid A=a, W=w, Z=z\} \equiv \E\{Y(a, z) \mid W=w\}\). This is a special, more
restrictive case of the standard assumption of no unmeasured counfounding in the
presence of mediators. The analogous randomization assumption is simply the
standard randomization assumption applied to a joint intervention on both the
treatment \(A\) and mediators \(Z\).
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Treatment Positivity]
For any \(a \in \mathcal{A}\) and \(w \in \mathcal{W}\), the conditional probability
of treatment \(g(a \mid w)\) is bounded away from the limits of the unit interval
by a small factor \(\xi > 0\). More precisely, \(\xi < g(a \mid w) < 1 - \xi\). This
mirrors the standard positivity assumption required for static interventions,
\protect\hyperlink{tmle3}{discussed previously}.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Mediator Positivity]
For any \(z \in \mathcal{Z}\), \(a \in \mathcal{A}\), and \(w \in \mathcal{W}\), the
conditional mediator density must be bounded away from zero by a small factor
\(\epsilon > 0\), specifically, \(\epsilon < q_{0,Z}(z \mid a, w)\). Essentially,
this requires that the conditional mediator density be bounded away from zero
for all \(\{z, a, w\}\) in their joint support \(\mathcal{Z} \times \mathcal{A} \times \mathcal{W}\), which is to say that it must be possible to observe any
given mediator value across all strata defined by both treatment \(A\) and
baseline covariates \(W\). A less restrictive form of this assumption is also
possible -- specifically, that the ratio of the mediator densities under both
treatment contrasts be bounded for the two realizations of the mediator density
under differing treatment contrasts.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Cross-world Counterfactual Independence]
For all \(a \neq a'\), where \(a, a' \in \mathcal{A}\), and \(z \in \mathcal{Z}\),
\(Y(a', z)\) must be independent of \(Z(a)\), given \(W\). That is, the counterfactual
outcome under the treatment contrast \(a' \in \mathcal{A}\) and the counterfactual
mediator value \(Z(a) \in \mathcal{Z}\) (under the alternative contrast \(a \in \mathcal{A}\)) must both be \emph{observable}. The term ``cross-world'' refers to the two
counterfactuals \(Z(a)\) and \(Y(a', z)\) existing under two differing treatment
contrasts. Though their joint distribution is well-defined, these
counterfactuals can never be jointly realized.
\end{definition}

While the first three assumptions may be familiar based on their analogs in
simpler settings, the cross-world independence requirement is unique to
identification of the natural direct and indirect effects. This assumption
resolves a challenging complication to the identification of these path-specific
effects, which has been termed the ``recanting witness'' by
\citet{avin2005identifiability}, who introduce a graphical resolution equivalent to
this assumption. This independence of counterfactuals indexed by distinct
interventions is, in fact, a serious limitation to the scientific relevance of
these effect definitions, as it results in the NDE and NIE being unidentifiable
in randomized trials \citep{robins2010alternative}, implying that corresponding
scientific claims cannot be falsified through experimentation \citep{popper1934logic, dawid2000causal} and, consequently, directly contradicting a foundational
pillar of the scientific method.

While many attempts have been made to weaken this last assumption
\citep{petersen2006estimation, imai2010identification, vansteelandt2012imputation, vansteelandt2012natural}, these results either impose stringent modeling
assumptions, propose alternative interpretations of the natural effects, or
provide a limited degree of additional flexibility by developing conditions that
may more easily be satisfied. For example, \citet{petersen2006estimation} weaken this
assumption by requiring it only for conditional means (rather than distinct
counterfactuals) and adopt a view of the natural direct effect as a weighted
average of another type of direct effect, the controlled direct effect. The
motivated reader may wish to further examine these details independently. We
next review estimation of the NDE and NIE, which remain widely used in modern
applications of causal mediation analysis.

\hypertarget{estimating-the-natural-direct-effect}{%
\subsection{Estimating the Natural Direct Effect}\label{estimating-the-natural-direct-effect}}

The NDE is defined as
\begin{align*}
  \psi_{\text{NDE}} =&~\E[Y(1, Z(0)) - Y(0, Z(0))] \\
  =& \sum_w \sum_z
  [\underbrace{\E(Y \mid A = 1, z, w)}_{\overline{Q}_Y(A = 1, z, w)} -
  \underbrace{\E(Y \mid A = 0, z, w)}_{\overline{Q}_Y(A = 0, z, w)}] \\
  &\times \underbrace{p(z \mid A = 0, w)}_{q_Z(Z \mid 0, w))}
  \underbrace{p(w)}_{q_W},
\end{align*}
where the likelihood factors arise from a factorization of the joint
likelihood:
\begin{equation*}
  p(w, a, z, y) = \underbrace{p(y \mid w, a, z)}_{q_Y(A, W, Z)}
  \underbrace{p(z \mid w, a)}_{q_Z(Z \mid A, W)}
  \underbrace{p(a \mid w)}_{g(A \mid W)}
  \underbrace{p(w)}_{q_W}.
\end{equation*}

The process of estimating the NDE begins by constructing \(\overline{Q}_{Y, n}\),
an estimate of the conditional mean of the outcome, given \(Z\), \(A\), and \(W\).
With an estimate of this conditional mean in hand, predictions of the
quantities \(\overline{Q}_Y(Z, 1, W)\) (setting \(A = 1\)) and,
likewise, \(\overline{Q}_Y(Z, 0, W)\) (setting \(A = 0\)) are readily obtained. We
denote the difference of these conditional means \(\overline{Q}_{\text{diff}} = \overline{Q}_Y(Z, 1, W) - \overline{Q}_Y(Z, 0, W)\), which is itself only a
functional parameter of the data distribution. \(\overline{Q}_{\text{diff}}\)
captures differences in the conditional mean of \(Y\) across contrasts of \(A\).

A procedure for constructing a targeted maximum likelihood (TML) estimator of
the NDE treats \(\overline{Q}_{\text{diff}}\) itself as a nuisance parameter,
regressing its estimate \(\overline{Q}_{\text{diff}, n}\) on baseline covariates
\(W\), among observations in the control condition only (i.e., those for whom
\(A = 0\) is observed); the goal of this step is to remove part of the marginal
impact of \(Z\) on \(\overline{Q}_{\text{diff}}\), since the covariates \(W\) precede
the mediators \(Z\) in time. Regressing this difference on \(W\) among the controls
recovers the expected \(\overline{Q}_{\text{diff}}\), under the setting in which
all individuals are treated as falling in the control condition \(A = 0\). Any
residual additive effect of \(Z\) on \(\overline{Q}_{\text{diff}}\) is removed
during the TML estimation step using the auxiliary (or ``clever'') covariate,
which accounts for the mediators \(Z\). This auxiliary covariate takes the form

\begin{equation*}
  C_Y(q_Z, g)(O) = \Bigg\{\frac{\mathbb{I}(A = 1)}{g(1 \mid W)}
  \frac{q_Z(Z \mid 0, W)}{q_Z(Z \mid 1, W)} -
  \frac{\mathbb{I}(A = 0)}{g(0 \mid W)} \Bigg\} \ .
\end{equation*}
Breaking this down, \(\mathbb{I}(A = 1) / g(1 \mid W)\) is the inverse propensity
score weight for \(A = 1\) and, likewise, \(\mathbb{I}(A = 0) / g(0 \mid W)\) is the
inverse propensity score weight for \(A = 0\). The middle term is the ratio of the
conditional densities of the mediator under the control (\(A = 0\)) and treatment
(\(A = 1\)) conditions (n.b., recall the mediator positivity condition above).

This subtle appearance of a ratio of conditional densities is concerning --
tools to estimate such quantities are sparse in the statistics literature
\citep{diaz2011super, hejazi2020haldensify}, unfortunately, and the problem is still
more complicated (and computationally taxing) when \(Z\) is high-dimensional. As
only the ratio of these conditional densities is required, a convenient
re-parametrization may be achieved, that is,
\begin{equation*}
  \frac{p(A = 0 \mid Z, W)}{g(0 \mid W)}
  \frac{g(1 \mid W)}{p(A = 1 \mid Z, W)} \ .
\end{equation*}
Going forward, we will denote this re-parameterized conditional probability
functional \(e(A \mid Z, W) := p(A \mid Z, W)\). The same re-parameterization
technique has been used by \citet{zheng2012targeted}, \citet{tchetgen2013inverse},
\citet{diaz2020causal}, \citet{diaz2020nonparametric}, and \citet{hejazi2021nonparametric} in similar
contexts. This reformulation is particularly useful for the fact that it reduces
the estimation problem to one requiring only the estimation of conditional
means, opening the door to the use of a \protect\hyperlink{sl3}{wide range of machine learning
algorithms, as discussed previously}.

Underneath the hood, the mean outcome difference \(\overline{Q}_{\text{diff}}\)
and \(e(A \mid Z, W)\), the conditional probability of \(A\) given \(Z\) and \(W\), are
used in constructing the auxiliary covariate for TML estimation. These nuisance
parameters play an important role in the bias-correcting update step of the TML
estimation procedure.

\hypertarget{estimating-the-natural-indirect-effect}{%
\subsection{Estimating the Natural Indirect Effect}\label{estimating-the-natural-indirect-effect}}

Derivation and estimation of the NIE is analogous to that of the NDE. Recall
that the NIE is the effect of \(A\) on \(Y\) \emph{only through the mediator \(Z\)}.
This counterfactual quantity, which may be expressed \(\E(Y(Z(1), 1) - \E(Y(Z(0), 1)\), corresponds to the difference of the conditional mean of \(Y\)
given \(A = 1\) and \(Z(1)\) (the values the mediator would take under \(A = 1\)) and
the conditional expectation of \(Y\) given \(A = 1\) and \(Z(0)\) (the values the
mediator would take under \(A = 0\)).

As with the NDE, re-parameterization can be used to replace \(q_Z(Z \mid A, W)\)
with \(e(A \mid Z, W)\) in the estimation process, avoiding estimation of a
possibly multivariate conditional density. However, in this case, the mediated
mean outcome difference, previously computed by regressing
\(\overline{Q}_{\text{diff}}\) on \(W\) among the control units (for whom \(A = 0\) is
observed) is instead replaced by a two-step process. First, \(\overline{Q}_Y(Z, 1, W)\), the conditional mean of \(Y\) given \(Z\) and \(W\) when \(A = 1\), is regressed
on \(W\), among only the treated units (i.e., for whom \(A = 1\) is observed). Then,
the same quantity, \(\overline{Q}_Y(Z, 1, W)\) is again regressed on \(W\), but this
time among only the control units (i.e., for whom \(A = 0\) is observed). The mean
difference of these two functionals of the data distribution is a valid
estimator of the NIE. It can be thought of as the additive marginal effect of
treatment on the conditional mean of \(Y\) given \((W, A = 1, Z)\) through its
effect on \(Z\). So, in the case of the NIE, while our estimand
\(\psi_{\text{NIE}}\) is different, the same estimation techniques useful for
constructing efficient estimators of the NDE come into play.

\hypertarget{the-population-intervention-direct-and-indirect-effects}{%
\section{The Population Intervention Direct and Indirect Effects}\label{the-population-intervention-direct-and-indirect-effects}}

At times, the natural direct and indirect effects may prove too limiting, as
these effect definitions are based on \emph{static interventions} (i.e., setting
\(A = 0\) or \(A = 1\)), which may be unrealistic for real-world interventions. In
such cases, one may turn instead to the population intervention direct effect
(PIDE) and the population intervention indirect effect (PIIE), which are based
on decomposing the effect of the population intervention effect (PIE) of
flexible stochastic interventions \citep{diaz2020causal}.

We previously discussed stochastic interventions when considering \protect\hyperlink{shift}{how to
intervene on continuous-valued treatments}; however, these intervention
schemes may be applied to all manner of treatment variables.
A particular type of stochastic intervention well-suited to working with binary
treatments is the \emph{incremental propensity score intervention} (IPSI), first
proposed by \citet{kennedy2019nonparametric}. Such interventions do not
deterministically set the treatment level of an observed unit to a fixed
quantity (i.e., setting \(A = 1\)), but instead \emph{alter the odds of receiving the
treatment} by a fixed amount (\(0 \leq \delta \leq \infty\)) for each individual.
In particular, this intervention takes the form
\begin{equation*}
  g_{\delta}(1 \mid w) = \frac{\delta g(1 \mid w)}{\delta g(1 \mid w) + 1
  - g(1\mid w)},
\end{equation*}
where the scalar \(0 < \delta < \infty\) specifies a \emph{change in the odds of
receiving treatment}. As described by \citet{diaz2020causal} in the context of causal
mediation analysis, the identification assumptions required for the PIDE and the
PIIE are significantly more lax than those required for the NDE and NIE. These
identification assumptions include the following. Importantly, the assumption of
cross-world counterfactual independence is not at all required.

\begin{definition}[Conditional Exchangeability of Treatment and Mediators]
Assume that \(\E\{Y(a, z) \mid Z, A, W\} = \E\{Y(a, z) \mid Z, W\}~\forall~(a, z) \in \mathcal{A} \times \mathcal{Z}W\). This assumption is
stronger than and implied by the assumption \(Y(a, z) \indep (A,Z) \mid W\),
originally proposed by \citet{vansteelandt2012natural} for identification of mediated
effects among the treated. In introducing this assumption \citet{diaz2020causal} state
that ``This assumption would be satisfied for any pre-exposure \(W\) in a
randomized experiment in which exposure and mediators are randomized. Thus, the
direct effect for a population intervention corresponds to contrasts between
treatment regimes of a randomized experiment via interventions on \(A\) and \(Z\),
unlike the natural direct effect for the average treatment effect
\citep{robins2010alternative}.''
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Common Support of Treatment and Mediators]
Assume that \(\text{supp}\{g_{\delta}(\cdot \mid w)\} \subseteq \text{supp}\{g(\cdot \mid w)\}~\forall~w \in \mathcal{W}\). This assumption is
standard and requires only that the post-intervention value of \(A\) be supported
in the data. Note that this is significantly weaker than the treatment and
mediator positivity conditions required for the natural direct and indirect
effects, and it is a direct consequence of using stochastic (rather than static)
interventions.
\end{definition}

\hypertarget{decomposing-the-population-intervention-effect}{%
\subsection{Decomposing the Population Intervention Effect}\label{decomposing-the-population-intervention-effect}}

We may decompose the population intervention effect (PIE) in terms of the
\emph{population intervention direct effect} (PIDE) and the \emph{population
intervention indirect effect} (PIIE):
\begin{equation*}
  \mathbb{E}\{Y(A_\delta)\} - \mathbb{E}Y =
    \overbrace{\mathbb{E}\{Y(A_\delta, Z(A_\delta))
      - Y(A_\delta, Z)\}}^{\text{PIIE}} +
    \overbrace{\mathbb{E}\{Y(A_\delta, Z) - Y(A, Z)\}}^{\text{PIDE}}.
\end{equation*}

This decomposition of the PIE as the sum of the population intervention direct
and indirect effects has an interpretation analogous to the corresponding
standard decomposition of the average treatment effect. In the sequel, we will
compute each of the components of the direct and indirect effects above using
appropriate estimators as follows

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  For \(\E\{Y(A, Z)\}\), the sample mean \(\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n Y_i\) is
  consistent;
\item
  for \(\E\{Y(A_{\delta}, Z)\}\), a TML estimator for the effect of a joint
  intervention altering the treatment mechanism but not the mediation mechanism,
  based on the proposal in \citet{diaz2020causal}; and,
\item
  for \(\E\{Y(A_{\delta}, Z_{A_{\delta}})\}\), an efficient estimator for the
  effect of a joint intervention on both the treatment and mediation mechanisms,
  as per \citet{kennedy2019nonparametric}.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{estimating-the-effect-decomposition-term}{%
\subsection{Estimating the Effect Decomposition Term}\label{estimating-the-effect-decomposition-term}}

As described by \citet{diaz2020causal}, the statistical functional identifying the
decomposition term that appears in both the PIDE and PIIE \(\E\{Y(A_{\delta}, Z)\}\), which corresponds to altering the treatment mechanism while keeping the
mediation mechanism fixed, is
\begin{equation*}
  \psi_0(\delta) = \int \overline{Q}_{0,Y}(a, z, w)
    g_{0,\delta}(a \mid w) p_0(z, w) d\nu(a, z, w),
\end{equation*}
for which a TML estimator is available. In the case of \(A \in \{0, 1\}\), the
\emph{efficient influence function} (EIF) with respect to the nonparametric
statistical model \(\mathcal{M}\) is \(D_{\delta}(o) = D^Y_{\delta}(o) + D^A_{\delta}(o) + D^{Z,W}_{\delta}(o) - \psi(\delta)\), where the
orthogonal components of the EIF are defined as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \(D^Y_{\delta}(o) = \{g_{\delta}(a \mid w) / e(a \mid z, w)\} \{y - \overline{Q}_{Y}(z,a,w)\}\),
\item
  \(D^A_{\delta}(o) = \{\delta\phi(w) (a - g(1 \mid w))\} / \{(\delta g(1 \mid w) + g(0 \mid w))^2\}\), and where \(\phi(w) := \E\{\overline{Q}_{Y}(1, Z, W) - \overline{Q}_{Y}(0, Z, W) \mid W = w\}\),
\item
  \(D^{Z,W}_{\delta}(o) = \int_{\mathcal{A}} \overline{Q}_{Y}(z, a, w) g_{\delta}(a \mid w) d\kappa(a)\).
\end{itemize}

The TML estimator may be computed by fluctuating initial estimates of the
nuisance parameters so as to solve the EIF estimating equation. The resultant
TML estimator is
\begin{equation*}
  \psi_{n}^{\star}(\delta) = \int_{\mathcal{A}} \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n
  \overline{Q}_{Y,n}^{\star}(Z_i, a, W_i)
  g_{\delta, n}^{\star}(a \mid W_i) d\kappa(a),
\end{equation*}
where \(g_{\delta,n}^{\star}(a \mid w)\) and \(\overline{Q}_{Y,n}^{\star}(z,a,w)\)
are generated by \textit{targeting} regressions that fluctuate (or tilt) initial
nuisance parameter estimates towards solutions of the score equations \(n^{-1} \sum_{i=1}^n D^A_{\delta}(O_i) = 0\) and \(n^{-1} \sum_{i=1}^n D^Y_{\delta}(O_i) = 0\), respectively. This TML estimator \(\psi_{n}^{\star}(\delta)\) is implemented
in \passthrough{\lstinline!tmle3mediate!} package. We demonstrate the use of \passthrough{\lstinline!tmle3mediate!} to obtain
\(\E\{Y(A_{\delta}, Z)\}\) via its TML estimator in the following worked code
examples.

\hypertarget{evaluating-the-direct-and-indirect-effects}{%
\section{Evaluating the Direct and Indirect Effects}\label{evaluating-the-direct-and-indirect-effects}}

We now turn to estimating the natural direct and indirect effects, as well as
the population intervention direct effect, using the WASH Benefits data,
introduced in earlier chapters. Let's first load the data:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=R]
library(data.table)
library(sl3)
library(tmle3)
library(tmle3mediate)

# download data
washb_data <- fread(
  paste0(
    "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tlverse/tlverse-data/master/",
    "wash-benefits/washb_data.csv"
  ),
  stringsAsFactors = TRUE
)

# make intervention node binary and subsample
washb_data <- washb_data[sample(.N, 600), ]
washb_data[, tr := as.numeric(tr != "Control")]
\end{lstlisting}

We'll next define the baseline covariates \(W\), treatment \(A\), mediators \(Z\),
and outcome \(Y\) nodes of the NPSEM via a ``Node List'' object:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=R]
node_list <- list(
  W = c(
    "momage", "momedu", "momheight", "hfiacat", "Nlt18", "Ncomp", "watmin",
    "elec", "floor", "walls", "roof"
  ),
  A = "tr",
  Z = c("sex", "month", "aged"),
  Y = "whz"
)
\end{lstlisting}

Here, the \passthrough{\lstinline!node\_list!} encodes the parents of each node -- for example, \(Z\) (the
mediators) have parents \(A\) (the treatment) and \(W\) (the baseline confounders),
and \(Y\) (the outcome) has parents \(Z\), \(A\), and \(W\). We'll also handle any
missingness in the data by invoking \passthrough{\lstinline!process\_missing!}:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=R]
processed <- process_missing(washb_data, node_list)
washb_data <- processed$data
node_list <- processed$node_list
\end{lstlisting}

We'll now construct an ensemble learner using a handful of popular machine
learning algorithms:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=R]
# SL learners used for continuous data (the nuisance parameter Z)
enet_contin_learner <- Lrnr_glmnet$new(
  alpha = 0.5, family = "gaussian", nfolds = 3
)
lasso_contin_learner <- Lrnr_glmnet$new(
  alpha = 1, family = "gaussian", nfolds = 3
)
fglm_contin_learner <- Lrnr_glm_fast$new(family = gaussian())
mean_learner <- Lrnr_mean$new()
contin_learner_lib <- Stack$new(
  enet_contin_learner, lasso_contin_learner, fglm_contin_learner, mean_learner
)
sl_contin_learner <- Lrnr_sl$new(learners = contin_learner_lib)

# SL learners used for binary data (nuisance parameters G and E in this case)
enet_binary_learner <- Lrnr_glmnet$new(
  alpha = 0.5, family = "binomial", nfolds = 3
)
lasso_binary_learner <- Lrnr_glmnet$new(
  alpha = 1, family = "binomial", nfolds = 3
)
fglm_binary_learner <- Lrnr_glm_fast$new(family = binomial())
binary_learner_lib <- Stack$new(
  enet_binary_learner, lasso_binary_learner, fglm_binary_learner, mean_learner
)
sl_binary_learner <- Lrnr_sl$new(learners = binary_learner_lib)

# create list for treatment and outcome mechanism regressions
learner_list <- list(
  Y = sl_contin_learner,
  A = sl_binary_learner
)
\end{lstlisting}

\hypertarget{targeted-estimation-of-the-natural-indirect-effect}{%
\subsection{Targeted Estimation of the Natural Indirect Effect}\label{targeted-estimation-of-the-natural-indirect-effect}}

We demonstrate calculation of the NIE below, starting by instantiating a ``Spec''
object that encodes exactly which learners to use for the nuisance parameters
\(e(A \mid Z, W)\) and \(\psi_Z\). We then pass our Spec object to the \passthrough{\lstinline!tmle3!}
function, alongside the data, the node list (created above), and a learner list
indicating which machine learning algorithms to use for estimating the nuisance
parameters based on \(A\) and \(Y\).

\begin{lstlisting}[language=R]
tmle_spec_NIE <- tmle_NIE(
  e_learners = Lrnr_cv$new(lasso_binary_learner, full_fit = TRUE),
  psi_Z_learners = Lrnr_cv$new(lasso_contin_learner, full_fit = TRUE),
  max_iter = 1
)
washb_NIE <- tmle3(
  tmle_spec_NIE, washb_data, node_list, learner_list
)
washb_NIE
A tmle3_Fit that took 1 step(s)
   type                  param init_est tmle_est      se    lower   upper
1:  NIE NIE[Y_{A=1} - Y_{A=0}] 0.002419 0.003376 0.04342 -0.08173 0.08848
   psi_transformed lower_transformed upper_transformed
1:        0.003376          -0.08173           0.08848
\end{lstlisting}

Based on the output, we conclude that the indirect effect of the treatment
through the mediators (sex, month, aged) is
0.0034.

\hypertarget{targeted-estimation-of-the-natural-direct-effect}{%
\subsection{Targeted Estimation of the Natural Direct Effect}\label{targeted-estimation-of-the-natural-direct-effect}}

An analogous procedure applies for estimation of the NDE, only replacing the
Spec object for the NIE with \passthrough{\lstinline!tmle\_spec\_NDE!} to define learners for the NDE
nuisance parameters:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=R]
tmle_spec_NDE <- tmle_NDE(
  e_learners = Lrnr_cv$new(lasso_binary_learner, full_fit = TRUE),
  psi_Z_learners = Lrnr_cv$new(lasso_contin_learner, full_fit = TRUE),
  max_iter = 1
)
washb_NDE <- tmle3(
  tmle_spec_NDE, washb_data, node_list, learner_list
)
washb_NDE
A tmle3_Fit that took 1 step(s)
   type                  param init_est tmle_est      se   lower  upper
1:  NDE NDE[Y_{A=1} - Y_{A=0}]   0.0148   0.0148 0.08569 -0.1532 0.1828
   psi_transformed lower_transformed upper_transformed
1:          0.0148           -0.1532            0.1828
\end{lstlisting}

From this, we can draw the conclusion that the direct effect of the treatment
(through all paths not involving the mediators (sex, month, aged)) is
0.0148. Note that, together, the estimates of
the natural direct and indirect effects approximately recover the \emph{average
treatment effect}, that is, based on these estimates of the NDE and NIE, the
ATE is roughly
0.0182.

\subsection{Targeted Estimation of the Population Intervention Direct Effect}\label{targeted-estimation-of-the-population-intervention-direct-effect}}

As previously noted, the assumptions underlying the natural direct and indirect
effects may be challenging to justify; moreover, the effect definitions
themselves depend on the application of a static intervention to the treatment,
sharply limiting their flexibility. When considering binary treatments,
incremental propensity score shifts provide an alternative class of flexible,
stochastic interventions. We'll now consider estimating the PIDE with an IPSI
that modulates the odds of receiving treatment by \(\delta = 3\). Such an
intervention may be interpreted (hypothetically) as the effect of a design that
encourages study participants to opt in to receiving the treatment, thus
increasing their relative odds of receiving said treatment. To exemplify our
approach, we postulate a motivational intervention that \emph{triples the odds}
(i.e., \(\delta = 3\)) of receiving the treatment for each individual:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=R]
# set the IPSI multiplicative shift
delta_ipsi <- 3

# instantiate tmle3 spec for stochastic mediation
tmle_spec_pie_decomp <- tmle_medshift(
  delta = delta_ipsi,
  e_learners = Lrnr_cv$new(lasso_binary_learner, full_fit = TRUE),
  phi_learners = Lrnr_cv$new(lasso_contin_learner, full_fit = TRUE)
)

# compute the TML estimate
washb_pie_decomp <- tmle3(
  tmle_spec_pie_decomp, washb_data, node_list, learner_list
)
washb_pie_decomp

# get the PIDE
washb_pie_decomp$summary$tmle_est - mean(washb_data[, get(node_list$Y)])
\end{lstlisting}

Recall that, based on the decomposition outlined previously, the PIDE may be
denoted \(\beta_{0,\text{PIDE}}(\delta) = \psi_0(\delta) - \E Y\). Thus,
a TML estimator of the PIDE, \(\beta_{n,\text{PIDE}}(\delta)\) may be expressed
as a composition of estimators of its constituent parameters:
\begin{equation*}
  \beta_{n,\text{PIDE}}({\delta}) = \psi^{\star}_{n}(\delta) -
  \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i = 1}^n Y_i.
\end{equation*}

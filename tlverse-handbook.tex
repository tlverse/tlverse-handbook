\section*{What this book is not}\label{what-this-book-is-not}}


The focus of this work is \textbf{not} on providing in-depth technical descriptions
of current statistical methodology or recent advancements. Instead, the goal is
to convey key details of state-of-the-art techniques in an manner that is both
clear and complete, without burdening the reader with extraneous information.
We hope that the presentations herein will serve as references for researchers
-- methodologists and domain specialists alike -- that empower them to deploy
the central tools of Targeted Learning in an efficient manner. For technical
details and in-depth descriptions of both classical theory and recent advances
in the field of Targeted Learning, the interested reader is invited to consult
\citet{vdl2011targeted} and/or \citet{vdl2018targeted} as appropriate. The primary literature
in statistical causal inference, machine learning, and non/semiparametric theory
include many of the most recent advances in Targeted Learning and related areas.

\hypertarget{mark-van-der-laan}{%
\subsection*{Mark van der Laan}\label{mark-van-der-laan}}


Mark van der Laan, PhD, is Professor of Biostatistics and Statistics at UC
Berkeley. His research interests include statistical methods in computational
biology, survival analysis, censored data, adaptive designs, targeted maximum
likelihood estimation, causal inference, data-adaptive loss-based learning, and
multiple testing. His research group developed loss-based super learning in
semiparametric models, based on cross-validation, as a generic optimal tool for
the estimation of infinite-dimensional parameters, such as nonparametric density
estimation and prediction with both censored and uncensored data. Building on
this work, his research group developed targeted maximum likelihood estimation
for a target parameter of the data-generating distribution in arbitrary
semiparametric and nonparametric models, as a generic optimal methodology for
statistical and causal inference. Most recently, Mark's group has focused in
part on the development of a centralized, principled set of software tools for
targeted learning, the \texttt{tlverse}.

he earned an MA in Biostatistics and a BA (with majors in Molecular and Cell
Biology, Psychology, and Public Health), both at UC Berkeley. His research
interests fall at the intersection of causal inference and machine learning,
drawing on ideas from non/semi-parametric estimation in large, flexible
statistical models to develop efficient and robust statistical procedures for
evaluating complex target estimands in observational and randomized studies.
Particular areas of current emphasis include mediation/path analysis,
outcome-dependent sampling designs, targeted loss-based estimation, and vaccine
efficacy trials. Nima is also passionate about statistical computing and open

\section{Learning resources}\label{learn}}

To effectively utilize this handbook, the reader need not be a fully trained
statistician to begin understanding and applying these methods. However, it is
highly recommended for the reader to have an understanding of basic statistical
concepts such as confounding, probability distributions, confidence intervals,
hypothesis tests, and regression. Advanced knowledge of mathematical statistics
may be useful but is not necessary. Familiarity with the \texttt{R} programming
language will be essential. We also recommend an understanding of introductory
causal inference.

For learning the \texttt{R} programming language we recommend the following (free)
introductory resources:

\begin{itemize}

  Follow the instructions for your distribution
  from \href{https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/linux}{CRAN}, they provide information
  to get the most recent version of R for common distributions. For most
  distributions, you could use your package manager (e.g., for Debian/Ubuntu run
  \texttt{sudo\ apt-get\ install\ r-base}, and for Fedora \texttt{sudo\ yum\ install\ R}), but we
  don't recommend this approach as the versions provided by this are
  usually out of date. In any case, make sure you have at least R 3.3.1.
\item
  Go to the \href{https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/\#download}{RStudio download
  page}
\item
  Under \emph{Installers} select the version that matches your distribution, and
  install it with your preferred method (e.g., with Debian/Ubuntu \texttt{sudo\ dpkg\ -i\ rstudio-x.yy.zzz-amd64.deb} at the terminal).
\item
  Once it's installed, open RStudio to make sure it works and you don't get any
  error messages.

\chapter{Robust Statistics and Reproducible Science}\label{robust}}

\begin{quote}
``One enemy of robust science is our humanity --- our appetite for
being right, and our tendency to find patterns in noise, to see supporting
evidence for what we already believe is true, and to ignore the facts that do
not fit.''

--- \citet{naturenews_2015}
\end{quote}

Scientific research is at a unique point in history. The need to improve rigor
and reproducibility in our field is greater than ever; corroboration moves
science forward, yet there is a growing alarm about results that cannot be
reproduced and that report false discoveries \citep{baker2016there}. Consequences of
not meeting this need will result in further decline in the rate of scientific
progression, the reputation of the sciences, and the public's trust in its
findings \citep{munafo2017manifesto, naturenews2_2015}.

\begin{quote}
``The key question we want to answer when seeing the results of any scientific
study is whether we can trust the data analysis.''

--- \citet{peng2015reproducibility}
\end{quote}

Unfortunately, at its current state the culture of data analysis and statistics
actually enables human bias through improper model selection. All hypothesis
tests and estimators are derived from statistical models, so to obtain valid
estimates and inference it is critical that the statistical model contains the
process that generated the data. Perhaps treatment was randomized or only
depended on a small number of baseline covariates; this knowledge should and
can be incorporated in the model. Alternatively, maybe the data is
observational, and there is no knowledge about the data-generating process (DGP).
If this is the case, then the statistical model should contain \emph{all} data
distributions. In practice; however, models are not selected based on knowledge
of the DGP, instead models are often selected based on (1) the p-values they
yield, (2) their convenience of implementation, and/or (3) an analysts loyalty
to a particular model. This practice of ``cargo-cult statistics --- the
ritualistic miming of statistics rather than conscientious practice,''
\citep{stark2018cargo} is characterized by arbitrary modeling choices, even though
these choices often result in different answers to the same research question.
That is, ``increasingly often, {[}statistics{]} is used instead to aid and
abet weak science, a role it can perform well when used mechanically or
ritually,'' as opposed to its original purpose of safeguarding against weak
science \citep{stark2018cargo}. This presents a fundamental drive behind the epidemic
of false findings that scientific research is suffering from \citep{vdl2014entering}.

\begin{quote}
``We suggest that the weak statistical understanding is probably due to
inadequate''statistics lite" education. This approach does not build up
appropriate mathematical fundamentals and does not provide scientifically
rigorous introduction into statistics. Hence, students' knowledge may remain
imprecise, patchy, and prone to serious misunderstandings. What this approach
achieves, however, is providing students with false confidence of being able
to use inferential tools whereas they usually only interpret the p-value
provided by black box statistical software. While this educational problem
remains unaddressed, poor statistical practices will prevail regardless of
what procedures and measures may be favored and/or banned by editorials."

--- \citet{szucs2017null}
\end{quote}

Our team at The University of California, Berkeley, is uniquely positioned to
provide such an education. Spearheaded by Professor Mark van der Laan, and
spreading rapidly by many of his students and colleagues who have greatly
enriched the field, the aptly named ``Targeted Learning'' methodology targets the
scientific question at hand and is counter to the current culture of
``convenience statistics'' which opens the door to biased estimation, misleading
results, and false discoveries. Targeted Learning restores the fundamentals that
formalized the field of statistics, such as the that facts that a statistical
model represents real knowledge about the experiment that generated the data,
and a target parameter represents what we are seeking to learn from the data as
a feature of the distribution that generated it \citep{vdl2014entering}. In this way,
Targeted Learning defines a truth and establishes a principled standard for
estimation, thereby inhibiting these all-too-human biases (e.g., hindsight bias,
confirmation bias, and outcome bias) from infiltrating analysis.

``The key for effective classical {[}statistical{]} inference is to have
well-defined questions and an analysis plan that tests those questions.''

\end{quote}

The objective for this handbook is to provide training to students, researchers,
industry professionals, faculty in science, public health, statistics, and other
fields to empower them with the necessary knowledge and skills to utilize the
sound methodology of Targeted Learning --- a technique that provides tailored
pre-specified machines for answering queries, so that each data analysis is
completely reproducible, and estimators are efficient, minimally biased, and
provide formal statistical inference.

Just as the conscientious use of modern statistical methodology is necessary to
ensure that scientific practice thrives, it remains critical to acknowledge the
role that robust software plays in allowing practitioners direct access to
published results. We recall that ``an article\ldots{}in a scientific publication is
not the scholarship itself, it is merely advertising of the scholarship. The
actual scholarship is the complete software development environment and the
complete set of instructions which generated the figures,'' thus making the
availability and adoption of robust statistical software key to enhancing the
transparency that is an inherent aspect of science \citep{buckheit1995wavelab}.

For a statistical methodology to be readily accessible in practice, it is
crucial that it is accompanied by robust user-friendly software
\citep{pullenayegum2016knowledge, stromberg2004write}. The \texttt{tlverse} software
ecosystem was developed to fulfill this need for the Targeted Learning
methodology. Not only does this software facilitate computationally reproducible
and efficient analyses, it is also a tool for Targeted Learning education since
its workflow mirrors that of the methodology. In particular, the \texttt{tlverse}
paradigm does not focus on implementing a specific estimator or a small set of
related estimators. Instead, the focus is on exposing the statistical framework
of Targeted Learning itself --- all \texttt{R} packages in the \texttt{tlverse} ecosystem
directly model the key objects defined in the mathematical and theoretical
framework of Targeted Learning. What's more, the \texttt{tlverse} \texttt{R} packages share a
core set of design principles centered on extensibility, allowing for them to be
used in conjunction with each other and built upon one other in a cohesive
fashion. For an introduction to Targeted Learning, we recommend the \href{https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.07333}{recent
review paper} from \citet{coyle2021targeted}.

In this handbook, the reader will embark on a journey through the \texttt{tlverse}
ecosystem. Guided by \texttt{R} programming exercises, case studies, and
intuitive explanation readers will build a toolbox for applying the Targeted
Learning statistical methodology, which will translate to real-world causal
inference analyses. Some preliminaries are required prior to this learning
endeavor -- we have made available a list of \protect\hyperlink{learn}{recommended learning
resources}.

\section*{Introduction}\label{introduction}}


The roadmap of statistical learning is concerned with the translation from
real-world data applications to a mathematical and statistical formulation of
the relevant estimation problem. This involves data as a random variable having
a probability distribution, scientific knowledge represented by a statistical
model, a statistical target parameter representing an answer to the question of
interest, and the notion of an estimator and sampling distribution of the
estimator.

\hypertarget{roadmap}{%
\section{The Roadmap}\label{roadmap}}

Following the roadmap is a process of five stages.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Data as a random variable with a probability distribution, \(O \sim P_0\).
\item
  The statistical model \(\M\) such that \(P_0 \in \M\).
\item
  The statistical target parameter \(\Psi\) and estimand \(\Psi(P_0)\).
\item
  The estimator \(\hat{\Psi}\) and estimate \(\hat{\Psi}(P_n)\).
\item
  A measure of uncertainty for the estimate \(\hat{\Psi}(P_n)\).
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{data-a-random-variable-with-a-probability-distribution-o-sim-p_0}{%
\subsection*{\texorpdfstring{(1) Data: A random variable with a probability distribution, \(O \sim P_0\)}{(1) Data: A random variable with a probability distribution, O \textbackslash{}sim P\_0}}\label{data-a-random-variable-with-a-probability-distribution-o-sim-p_0}}


The data set we're confronted with is the result of an experiment and we can
view the data as a random variable, \(O\), because if we repeat the experiment
we would have a different realization of this experiment. In particular, if we
repeat the experiment many times we could learn the probability distribution,
\(P_0\), of our data. So, the observed data \(O\) with probability distribution
\(P_0\) are \(n\) independent identically distributed (i.i.d.) observations of the
random variable \(O; O_1, \ldots, O_n\). Note that while not all data are i.i.d.,
there are ways to handle non-i.i.d. data, such as establishing conditional
independence, stratifying data to create sets of identically distributed data,
etc. It is crucial that researchers be absolutely clear about what they actually
know about the data-generating distribution for a given problem of interest.
Unfortunately, communication between statisticians and researchers is often
fraught with misinterpretation. The roadmap provides a mechanism by which to
ensure clear communication between research and statistician -- it truly helps
with this communication!

\hypertarget{the-empirical-probability-measure-p_n}{%
\subsubsection*{\texorpdfstring{The empirical probability measure, \(P_n\)}{The empirical probability measure, P\_n}}\label{the-empirical-probability-measure-p_n}}


Once we have \(n\) of such i.i.d. observations we have an empirical probability
measure, \(P_n\). The empirical probability measure is an approximation of the
true probability measure \(P_0\), allowing us to learn from our data. For
example, we can define the empirical probability measure of a set, \(A\), to be
the proportion of observations which end up in \(A\). That is,
\begin{equation*}
  P_n(A) = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n} \I(O_i \in A)
\end{equation*}

In order to start learning something, we need to ask \emph{``What do we know about the
probability distribution of the data?''} This brings us to Step 2.

\hypertarget{the-statistical-model-m-such-that-p_0-in-m}{%
\subsection*{\texorpdfstring{(2) The statistical model \(\M\) such that \(P_0 \in \M\)}{(2) The statistical model \textbackslash{}M such that P\_0 \textbackslash{}in \textbackslash{}M}}\label{the-statistical-model-m-such-that-p_0-in-m}}


The statistical model \(\M\) is defined by the question we asked at the end of
Step 1. It is defined as the set of possible probability distributions for our
observed data. Often \(\M\) is very large (possibly infinite-dimensional), to
reflect the fact that statistical knowledge is limited. In the case that \(\M\) is
infinite-dimensional, we deem this a nonparametric statistical model.

Alternatively, if the probability distribution of the data at hand is described
by a finite number of parameters, then the statistical model is parametric. In
this case, we subscribe to the belief that the random variable \(O\) being
observed has, for example, a normal distribution with mean \(\mu\) and variance
\(\sigma^2\). Formally, a parametric model may be defined
\begin{equation*}
  \M = \{P_{\theta} : \theta \in \R^d \}
\end{equation*}

Sadly, the assumption that the data-generating distribution has a specific,
parametric form is all too common, especially since this is a leap of faith or
an assumption made of convenience. This practice of oversimplification in the
current culture of data analysis typically derails any attempt at trying to
answer the scientific question at hand; alas, such statements as the
ever-popular quip of Box that ``All models are wrong but some are useful''
encourage the data analyst to make arbitrary choices even when such a practice
often forces starkly different answers to the same estimation problem. The
Targeted Learning paradigm does not suffer from this bias since it defines the
statistical model through a representation of the true data-generating
distribution corresponding to the observed data.

Now, on to Step 3: \emph{``What are we trying to learn from the data?''}

\hypertarget{the-statistical-target-parameter-psi-and-estimand-psip_0}{%
\subsection*{\texorpdfstring{(3) The statistical target parameter \(\Psi\) and estimand \(\Psi(P_0)\)}{(3) The statistical target parameter \textbackslash{}Psi and estimand \textbackslash{}Psi(P\_0)}}\label{the-statistical-target-parameter-psi-and-estimand-psip_0}}


The statistical target parameter, \(\Psi\), is defined as a mapping from the
statistical model, \(\M\), to the parameter space (i.e., a real number) \(\R\). That
is, \(\Psi: \M \rightarrow \R\). The estimand may be seen as a representation of
the quantity that we wish to learn from the data, the answer to a well-specified
(often causal) question of interest. In contrast to purely statistical
estimands, causal estimands require \emph{identification from the observed data},
based on causal models that include several untestable assumptions, described in
more detail in the section on \protect\hyperlink{causal}{causal target parameters}.

For a simple example, consider a data set which contains observations of a
survival time on every subject, for which our question of interest is ``What's
the probability that someone lives longer than five years?'' We have,
\begin{equation*}
  \Psi(P_0) = \P(O > 5)
\end{equation*}

This answer to this question is the \textbf{estimand, \(\Psi(P_0)\)}, which is the
quantity we're trying to learn from the data. Once we have defined \(O\), \(\M\) and
\(\Psi(P_0)\) we have formally defined the statistical estimation problem.

\hypertarget{the-estimator-hatpsi-and-estimate-hatpsip_n}{%
\subsection*{\texorpdfstring{(4) The estimator \(\hat{\Psi}\) and estimate \(\hat{\Psi}(P_n)\)}{(4) The estimator \textbackslash{}hat\{\textbackslash{}Psi\} and estimate \textbackslash{}hat\{\textbackslash{}Psi\}(P\_n)}}\label{the-estimator-hatpsi-and-estimate-hatpsip_n}}


To obtain a good approximation of the estimand, we need an estimator, an \emph{a
priori}-specified algorithm defined as a mapping from the set of possible
empirical distributions, \(P_n\), which live in a non-parametric statistical
model, \(\M_{NP}\) (\(P_n \in \M_{NP}\)), to the parameter space of the parameter of
interest. That is, \(\hat{\Psi} : \M_{NP} \rightarrow \R^d\). The estimator is a
function that takes as input the observed data, a realization of \(P_n\), and
gives as output a value in the parameter space, which is the \textbf{estimate,
\(\hat{\Psi}(P_n)\)}.

Where the estimator may be seen as an operator that maps the observed data and
corresponding empirical distribution to a value in the parameter space, the
numerical output that produced such a function is the estimate. Thus, it is an
element of the parameter space based on the empirical probability distribution
of the observed data. If we plug in a realization of \(P_n\) (based on a sample
size \(n\) of the random variable \(O\)), we get back an estimate \(\hat{\Psi}(P_n)\)
of the true parameter value \(\Psi(P_0)\).

In order to quantify the uncertainty in our estimate of the target parameter
(i.e., to construct statistical inference), an understanding of the sampling
distribution of our estimator will be necessary. This brings us to Step 5.

\hypertarget{a-measure-of-uncertainty-for-the-estimate-hatpsip_n}{%
\subsection*{\texorpdfstring{(5) A measure of uncertainty for the estimate \(\hat{\Psi}(P_n)\)}{(5) A measure of uncertainty for the estimate \textbackslash{}hat\{\textbackslash{}Psi\}(P\_n)}}\label{a-measure-of-uncertainty-for-the-estimate-hatpsip_n}}


Since the estimator \(\hat{\Psi}\) is a function of the empirical distribution
\(P_n\), the estimator itself is a random variable with a sampling distribution.
So, if we repeat the experiment of drawing \(n\) observations we would every time
end up with a different realization of our estimate and our estimator has a
sampling distribution. The sampling distribution of some estimators can be
theoretically validated to be approximately normally distributed by a Central
Limit Theorem (CLT).

A \textbf{Central Limit Theorem} (CLTs) is a statement regarding the convergence of
the \textbf{sampling distribution of an estimator} to a normal distribution. In
general, we will construct estimators whose limit sampling distributions may be
shown to be approximately normal distributed as sample size increases. For large
enough \(n\) we have,
\begin{equation*}
  \hat{\Psi}(P_n) \sim N \left(\Psi(P_0), \frac{\sigma^2}{n}\right),
\end{equation*}
permitting statistical inference. Now, we can proceed to quantify the
uncertainty of our chosen estimator by construction of hypothesis tests and
confidence intervals. For example, we may construct a confidence interval at
level \((1 - \alpha)\) for our estimand, \(\Psi(P_0)\):
\begin{equation*}
  \hat{\Psi}(P_n) \pm z_{1 - \frac{\alpha}{2}}
    \left(\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}\right),
\end{equation*}
where \(z_{1 - \frac{\alpha}{2}}\) is the \((1 - \frac{\alpha}{2})^\text{th}\)
quantile of the standard normal distribution. Often, we will be interested in
constructing 95\% confidence intervals, corresponding to mass \(\alpha = 0.05\) in
either tail of the limit distribution; thus, we will typically take
\(z_{1 - \frac{\alpha}{2}} \approx 1.96\).

\emph{Note:} we will typically have to estimate the standard error,
\(\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}\).

A 95\% confidence interval means that if we were to take 100 different samples
of size \(n\) and compute a 95\% confidence interval for each sample, then
approximately 95 of the 100 confidence intervals would contain the estimand,
\(\Psi(P_0)\). More practically, this means that there is a 95\% probability
that the confidence interval procedure generates intervals containing the
true estimand value (or 95\% confidence of ``covering'' the true value). That is,
any single estimated confidence interval either will contain the true estimand
or will not (also called ``coverage'').

\hypertarget{roadmap-summary}{%
\section{Summary of the Roadmap}\label{roadmap-summary}}

Data, \(O\), is viewed as a random variable that has a probability distribution.
We often have \(n\) units of independent identically distributed units with
probability distribution \(P_0\), such that \(O_1, \ldots, O_n \sim P_0\). We have
statistical knowledge about the experiment that generated this data. In other
words, we make a statement that the true data distribution \(P_0\) falls in a
certain set called a statistical model, \(\M\). Often these sets are very large
because statistical knowledge is very limited - hence, these statistical models
are often infinite dimensional models. Our statistical query is, ``What are we
trying to learn from the data?'' denoted by the statistical target parameter,
\(\Psi\), which maps the \(P_0\) into the estimand, \(\Psi(P_0)\). At this point the
statistical estimation problem is formally defined and now we will need
statistical theory to guide us in the construction of estimators. There's a lot
of statistical theory we will review in this course that, in particular, relies
on the Central Limit Theorem, allowing us to come up with estimators that are
approximately normally distributed and also allowing us to come with statistical
inference (i.e., confidence intervals and hypothesis tests).

\hypertarget{causal}{%
\section{Causal Target Parameters}\label{causal}}

In many cases, we are interested in problems that ask questions regarding the
effect of an intervention on a future outcome of interest. These questions can
be represented as causal estimands.

\hypertarget{the-causal-model}{%
\subsection*{The Causal Model}\label{the-causal-model}}


After formalizing the data and the statistical model, we can define a causal
model to express causal parameters of interest. Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs)
are one useful tool to express what we know about the causal relations among
variables. Ignoring exogenous \(U\) terms (explained below), we assume the
following ordering of the variables in the observed data \(O\). We do this below
using \texttt{DAGitty} \citep{textor2011dagitty}:

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{02-roadmap_files/figure-latex/simple-DAG-1} \end{center}

While directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) like above provide a convenient means by
which to visualize causal relations between variables, the same causal relations
among variables can be represented via a set of structural equations, which
define the non-parametric structural equation model (NPSEM):
\begin{align*}
  W &= f_W(U_W) \\
  A &= f_A(W, U_A) \\
  Y &= f_Y(W, A, U_Y),
\end{align*}
where \(U_W\), \(U_A\), and \(U_Y\) represent the unmeasured exogenous background
characteristics that influence the value of each variable. In the NPSEM, \(f_W\),
\(f_A\) and \(f_Y\) denote that each variable (for \(W\), \(A\) and \(Y\), respectively)
is a function of its parents and unmeasured background characteristics, but note
that there is no imposition of any particular functional constraints(e.g.,
linear, logit-linear, only one interaction, etc.). For this reason, they are
called non-parametric structural equation models (NPSEMs). The DAG and set of
nonparametric structural equations represent exactly the same information and so
may be used interchangeably.

The first hypothetical experiment we will consider is assigning exposure to the
whole population and observing the outcome, and then assigning no exposure to
the whole population and observing the outcome. On the nonparametric structural
equations, this corresponds to a comparison of the outcome distribution in the
population under two interventions:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \(A\) is set to \(1\) for all individuals, and
\item
  \(A\) is set to \(0\) for all individuals.
\end{enumerate}

These interventions imply two new nonparametric structural equation models. For
the case \(A = 1\), we have
\begin{align*}
  W &= f_W(U_W) \\
  A &= 1 \\
  Y(1) &= f_Y(W, 1, U_Y),
\end{align*}
and for the case \(A=0\),
\begin{align*}
  W &= f_W(U_W) \\
  A &= 0 \\
  Y(0) &= f_Y(W, 0, U_Y).
\end{align*}

In these equations, \(A\) is no longer a function of \(W\) because we have
intervened on the system, setting \(A\) deterministically to either of the values
\(1\) or \(0\). The new symbols \(Y(1)\) and \(Y(0)\) indicate the outcome variable in
our population if it were generated by the respective NPSEMs above; these are
often called \emph{counterfactuals} (since they run contrary-to-fact). The difference
between the means of the outcome under these two interventions defines a
parameter that is often called the ``average treatment effect'' (ATE), denoted
\begin{equation}
  ATE = \E_X(Y(1) - Y(0)),
  \label{eq:ate}
\end{equation}
where \(\E_X\) is the mean under the theoretical (unobserved) full data \(X = (W, Y(1), Y(0))\).

Note, we can define much more complicated interventions on NPSEM's, such as
interventions based upon rules (themselves based upon covariates), stochastic
rules, etc. and each results in a different targeted parameter and entails
different identifiability assumptions discussed below.

\hypertarget{identifiability}{%
\subsection*{Identifiability}\label{identifiability}}


Because we can never observe both \(Y(0)\) (the counterfactual outcome when \(A=0\))
and \(Y(1)\) (similarly, the counterfactual outcome when \(A=1\)), we cannot
estimate the quantity in Equation \eqref{eq:ate} directly. Instead, we have to
make assumptions under which this quantity may be estimated from the observed
data \(O \sim P_0\) under the data-generating distribution \(P_0\). Fortunately,
given the causal model specified in the NPSEM above, we can, with a handful of
untestable assumptions, estimate the ATE, even from observational data. These
assumptions may be summarized as follows.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  The causal graph implies \(Y(a) \perp A\) for all \(a \in \mathcal{A}\), which
  is the \emph{randomization} assumption. In the case of observational data, the
  analogous assumption is \emph{strong ignorability} or \emph{no unmeasured confounding}
  \(Y(a) \perp A \mid W\) for all \(a \in \mathcal{A}\);
\item
  Although not represented in the causal graph, also required is the assumption
  of no interference between units, that is, the outcome for unit \(i\) \(Y_i\) is
  not affected by exposure for unit \(j\) \(A_j\) unless \(i=j\);
\item
  \emph{Consistency} of the treatment mechanism is also required, i.e., the outcome
  for unit \(i\) is \(Y_i(a)\) whenever \(A_i = a\), an assumption also known as ``no
  other versions of treatment'';
\item
  It is also necessary that all observed units, across strata defined by \(W\),
  have a bounded (non-deterministic) probability of receiving treatment --
  that is, \(0 < \P(A = a \mid W) < 1\) for all \(a\) and \(W\)). This assumption
  is referred to as \emph{positivity} or \emph{overlap}.
\end{enumerate}

\emph{Remark}: Together, (2) and (3), the assumptions of no interference and
consistency, respectively, are jointly referred to as the \emph{stable unit
treatment value assumption} (SUTVA).

Given these assumptions, the ATE may be re-written as a function of \(P_0\),
specifically
\begin{equation}
  ATE = \E_0(Y(1) - Y(0)) = \E_0
    \left(\E_0[Y \mid A = 1, W] - \E_0[Y \mid A = 0, W]\right).
  \label{eq:estimand}
\end{equation}
In words, the ATE is the difference in the predicted outcome values for each
subject, under the contrast of treatment conditions (\(A = 0\) versus \(A = 1\)),
in the population, averaged over all observations. Thus, a parameter of a
theoretical ``full'' data distribution can be represented as an estimand of the
observed data distribution. Significantly, there is nothing about the
representation in Equation \eqref{eq:estimand} that requires parameteric
assumptions; thus, the regressions on the right hand side may be estimated
freely with machine learning. With different parameters, there will be
potentially different identifiability assumptions and the resulting estimands
can be functions of different components of \(P_0\). We discuss several more
complex estimands in later sections of this handbook.

\section{Installation}\label{installtlverse}}

The \texttt{tlverse} ecosystem of packages are currently hosted at
\url{https://github.com/tlverse}, not yet on \href{https://CRAN.R-project.org/}{CRAN}. You
can use the \href{https://usethis.r-lib.org/}{\texttt{usethis} package} to install them:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{install.packages}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"devtools"}\NormalTok{)}
\NormalTok{devtools}\OperatorTok{::}\KeywordTok{install_github}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"tlverse/tlverse"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

The \texttt{tlverse} depends on a large number of other packages that are also hosted
on GitHub. Because of this, you may see the following error:

\begin{verbatim}
Error: HTTP error 403.
  API rate limit exceeded for 71.204.135.82. (But here's the good news:
  Authenticated requests get a higher rate limit. Check out the documentation
  for more details.)

  Rate limit remaining: 0/60
  Rate limit reset at: 2019-03-04 19:39:05 UTC

  To increase your GitHub API rate limit
  - Use `usethis::browse_github_pat()` to create a Personal Access Token.
  - Use `usethis::edit_r_environ()` and add the token as `GITHUB_PAT`.
\end{verbatim}

This just means that R tried to install too many packages from GitHub in too
short of a window. To fix this, you need to tell R how to use GitHub as your
user (you'll need a GitHub user account). Follow these two steps:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Type \texttt{usethis::browse\_github\_pat()} in your R console, which will direct
  you to GitHub's page to create a New Personal Access Token (PAT).
\item
  Create a PAT simply by clicking ``Generate token'' at the bottom of the page.
\item
  Copy your PAT, a long string of lowercase letters and numbers.
\item
  Type \texttt{usethis::edit\_r\_environ()} in your R console, which will open your
  \texttt{.Renviron} file in the source window of RStudio.

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\alph{enumii}.}
  \tightlist
  \item
    If your \texttt{.Renviron} file does not pop-up after calling
    \texttt{usethis::edit\_r\_environ()}; then try inputting
    \texttt{Sys.setenv(GITHUB\_PAT\ =\ "yourPAT")}, replacing your PAT with inside the
    quotes. If this does not error, then skip to step 8.
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  In your \texttt{.Renviron} file, type \texttt{GITHUB\_PAT=} and then paste your PAT after
  the equals symbol with no space.
\item
  In your \texttt{.Renviron} file, press the enter key to ensure that your \texttt{.Renviron}
  ends with a new line.
\item
  Save your \texttt{.Renviron} file. The example below shows how this syntax should
  look.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{GITHUB_PAT <-}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{yourPAT}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{7}
\tightlist
\item
  Restart R. You can restart R via the drop-down menu on RStudio's ``Session''
  tab, which is located at the top of the RStudio interface. You have to
  restart R for the changes to take effect!
\end{enumerate}

After following these steps, you should be able to successfully install the
package which threw the error above.

\section{WASH Benefits Example Dataset}\label{wash}}

The data come from a study of the effect of water quality, sanitation, hand
washing, and nutritional interventions on child development in rural Bangladesh
(WASH Benefits Bangladesh): a cluster randomized controlled trial
\citep{luby2018effect}. The study enrolled pregnant women in their first or second
trimester from the rural villages of Gazipur, Kishoreganj, Mymensingh, and
Tangail districts of central Bangladesh, with an average of eight women per
cluster. Groups of eight geographically adjacent clusters were block randomized,
using a random number generator, into six intervention groups (all of which
received weekly visits from a community health promoter for the first 6 months
and every 2 weeks for the next 18 months) and a double-sized control group (no
intervention or health promoter visit). The six intervention groups were:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  chlorinated drinking water;
\item
  improved sanitation;
\item
  hand-washing with soap;
\item
  combined water, sanitation, and hand washing;
\item
  improved nutrition through counseling and provision of lipid-based nutrient
  supplements; and
\item
  combined water, sanitation, handwashing, and nutrition.
\end{enumerate}

In the handbook, we concentrate on child growth (size for age) as the outcome of
interest. For reference, this trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov as
NCT01590095.

For the purposes of this handbook, we start by treating the data as independent
and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random draws from a very large target
population. We could, with available options, account for the clustering of the
data (within sampled geographic units), but, for simplification, we avoid these
details in the handbook, although modifications of our methodology for biased
samples, repeated measures, and related complications, are available.

We have 28 variables measured, of which a single variable is set to
be the outcome of interest. This outcome, \(Y\), is the weight-for-height Z-score
(\texttt{whz} in \texttt{dat}); the treatment of interest, \(A\), is the randomized treatment
group (\texttt{tr} in \texttt{dat}); and the adjustment set, \(W\), consists simply of
\emph{everything else}. This results in our observed data structure being \(n\) i.i.d.
copies of \(O_i = (W_i, A_i, Y_i)\), for \(i = 1, \ldots, n\).

Using the \href{https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=skimr}{\texttt{skimr} package}, we can
quickly summarize the variables measured in the WASH Benefits data set:

A convenient summary of the relevant variables is given just above, complete
with a small visualization describing the marginal characteristics of each
covariate. Note that the \emph{asset} variables reflect socio-economic status of the
study participants. Notice also the uniform distribution of the treatment groups
(with twice as many controls); this is, of course, by design.

\section{International Stroke Trial Example Dataset}\label{ist}}

The International Stroke Trial database contains individual patient data from
the International Stroke Trial (IST), a multi-national randomized trial
conducted between 1991 and 1996 (pilot phase between 1991 and 1993) that aimed
to assess whether early administration of aspirin, heparin, both aspirin and
heparin, or neither influenced the clinical course of acute ischaemic stroke
\citep{sandercock1997international}. The IST dataset includes data on 19,435 patients
with acute stroke, with 99\% complete follow-up. De-identified data are
available for download at \url{https://datashare.is.ed.ac.uk/handle/10283/128}. This
study is described in more detail in \citet{sandercock2011international}. The example
data for this handbook considers a sample of 5,000 patients and the binary
outcome of recurrent ischemic stroke within 14 days after randomization. Also
in this example data, we ensure that we have subjects with a missing outcome.

We have 26 variables measured, and the outcome of interest, \(Y\),
indicates recurrent ischemic stroke within 14 days after randomization (\texttt{DRSISC}
in \texttt{ist}); the treatment of interest, \(A\), is the randomized aspirin vs.~no
aspirin treatment allocation (\texttt{RXASP} in \texttt{ist}); and the adjustment set, \(W\),
consists of all other variables measured at baseline. In this data, the outcome
is occasionally missing, but there is no need to create a variable indicating
this missingness (such as \(\Delta\)) for analyses in the \texttt{tlverse}, since it is
automatically detected when \texttt{NA} are present in the outcome. This observed data
structure can be denoted as \(n\) i.i.d. copies of \(O_i = (W_i, A_i, \Delta_i, \Delta Y_i)\), for \(i = 1, \ldots, n\), where \(\Delta\) denotes the binary
indicator that the outcome is observed.

Like before, we can summarize the variables measured in the IST sample data set
with \texttt{skimr}:

A central goal of the Targeted Learning statistical paradigm is to estimate
scientifically relevant parameters in realistic (usually nonparametric) models.

The \texttt{tlverse} is designed using basic OOP principles and the \texttt{R6} OOP framework.
While we've tried to make it easy to use the \texttt{tlverse} packages without worrying
much about OOP, it is helpful to have some intuition about how the \texttt{tlverse} is
structured. Here, we briefly outline some key concepts from OOP. Readers
familiar with OOP basics are invited to skip this section.

\hypertarget{classes-fields-and-methods}{%
\section{Classes, Fields, and Methods}\label{classes-fields-and-methods}}

The key concept of OOP is that of an object, a collection of data and functions
that corresponds to some conceptual unit. Objects have two main types of
elements:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \emph{fields}, which can be thought of as nouns, are information about an object,
  and
\item
  \emph{methods}, which can be thought of as verbs, are actions an object can
  perform.
\end{enumerate}

Objects are members of classes, which define what those specific fields and
methods are. Classes can inherit elements from other classes (sometimes called
base classes) -- accordingly, classes that are similar, but not exactly the
same, can share some parts of their definitions.

Many different implementations of OOP exist, with variations in how these
concepts are implemented and used. R has several different implementations,
including \texttt{S3}, \texttt{S4}, reference classes, and \texttt{R6}. The \texttt{tlverse} uses the \texttt{R6}
implementation. In \texttt{R6}, methods and fields of a class object are accessed using
the \texttt{\$} operator. For a more thorough introduction to \texttt{R}'s various OOP systems,
see \url{http://adv-r.had.co.nz/OO-essentials.html}, from Hadley Wickham's \emph{Advanced
R} \citep{wickham2014advanced}.

\hypertarget{object-oriented-programming-python-and-r}{%
\section{\texorpdfstring{Object Oriented Programming: \texttt{Python} and \texttt{R}}{Object Oriented Programming: Python and R}}\label{object-oriented-programming-python-and-r}}

OO concepts (classes with inherentence) were baked into Python from the first
published version (version 0.9 in 1991). In contrast, \texttt{R} gets its OO ``approach''
from its predecessor, \texttt{S}, first released in 1976. For the first 15 years, \texttt{S}
had no support for classes, then, suddenly, \texttt{S} got two OO frameworks bolted on
in rapid succession: informal classes with \texttt{S3} in 1991, and formal classes with
\texttt{S4} in 1998. This process continues, with new OO frameworks being periodically
released, to try to improve the lackluster OO support in \texttt{R}, with reference
classes (\texttt{R5}, 2010) and \texttt{R6} (2014). Of these, \texttt{R6} behaves most like Python
classes (and also most like OOP focused languages like C++ and Java), including
having method definitions be part of class definitions, and allowing objects to
be modified by reference.

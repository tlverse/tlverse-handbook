<p>Identifying which intervention will be effective for which patient based on
lifestyle, genetic and environmental factors is a common goal in precision
medicine. To put it in context, Abacavir and Tenofovir are commonly prescribed
as part of the antiretroviral therapy to Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)
patients. However, not all individuals benefit from the two medications equally.
In particular, patients with renal dysfunction might further deteriorate if
prescribed Tenofovir, due to the high nephrotoxicity caused by the medication.
While Tenofovir is still highly effective treatment option for HIV patients, in
order to maximize the patient’s well-being, it would be beneficial to prescribe
Tenofovir only to individuals with healthy kidney function. As an another example,
consider a HIV trial where our goal is to improve retention in HIV care.
In a randomized clinical trial, several interventions show efficacy- including
appointment reminders through text messages, small cash incentives for on time
clinic visits, and peer health workers. Ideally, we want to improve effectiveness
by assigning each patient the intervention they are most likely to benefit from,
as well as improve efficiency by not allocating resources to individuals that do not need
them, or would not benefit from it.</p>

<p>One opts to administer the intervention to individuals who will profit from it,
instead of assigning treatment on a population level. But how do we know which
intervention works for which patient? This aim motivates a different type of
intervention, as opposed to the static exposures we described in previous chapters.
In particular, in this chapter we learn about dynamic or “individualized”
interventions that tailor the treatment decision based on the collected
covariates. Formally, dynamic treatments represent interventions that at each
treatment-decision stage are allowed to respond to the currently available
treatment and covariate history. A dynamic treatment rule can be thought of as
a rule where the input is the available set of collected covariates, and the
output is an individualized treatment for each patient
<span class="citation">(Bembom and van der Laan <a href="references.html#ref-bembom2007realistic" role="doc-biblioref">2007</a>; J. Robins <a href="references.html#ref-robins1986" role="doc-biblioref">1986</a>; Chakraborty and Moodie <a href="references.html#ref-moodie2013" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>In the statistics community such a treatment strategy is termed an
<strong>individualized treatment regime</strong> (ITR), also known as the optimal
dynamic treatment rule, optimal treatment regime, optimal strategy,
and optimal policy <span class="citation">(Murphy <a href="references.html#ref-murphy2003" role="doc-biblioref">2003</a>; Robins <a href="references.html#ref-robins2004" role="doc-biblioref">2004</a>)</span>. The (counterfactual)
population mean outcome under an ITR is the value of the ITR <span class="citation">(Murphy <a href="references.html#ref-murphy2003" role="doc-biblioref">2003</a>; Robins <a href="references.html#ref-robins2004" role="doc-biblioref">2004</a>)</span>.
Even more, suppose one wishes to maximize the population mean of an
outcome, where for each individual we have access to some set of measured
covariates. This means, for example, that we can learn for which individual
characteristics assigning treatment increases the probability of a beneficial
outcome. An ITR with the maximal value is referred to as an
optimal ITR or the <strong>optimal individualized treatment</strong>. Consequently, the value
of an optimal ITR is termed the optimal value, or the
<strong>mean under the optimal individualized treatment</strong>.</p>
<p>The problem of estimating the optimal individualized treatment has received much
attention in the statistics literature over the years, especially with the
advancement of precision medicine; see <span class="citation">Murphy (<a href="references.html#ref-murphy2003" role="doc-biblioref">2003</a>)</span>, <span class="citation">Robins (<a href="references.html#ref-robins2004" role="doc-biblioref">2004</a>)</span>, <span class="citation">Zhang et al. (<a href="references.html#ref-laber2012" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a>)</span>,
<span class="citation">Zhao et al. (<a href="references.html#ref-kosorok2012" role="doc-biblioref">2012</a>)</span>, <span class="citation">Chakraborty and Moodie (<a href="references.html#ref-moodie2013" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a>)</span> and <span class="citation">Robins and Rotnitzky (<a href="references.html#ref-robins2014" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a>)</span> to name a few. However, much of the
early work depends on parametric assumptions. As such, even in a randomized
trial, the statistical inference for the optimal individualized treatment relies
on assumptions that are generally believed to be false, and can lead to biased
results.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we consider estimation of the mean outcome under the optimal
individualized treatment where the candidate rules are restricted to depend only
on user-supplied subset of the baseline covariates. The estimation problem is
addressed in a statistical model for the data distribution that is
nonparametric, and at most places restrictions on the probability of a patient
receiving treatment given covariates (as in a randomized trial). As such, we
don’t need to make any assumptions about the relationship of the outcome with
the treatment and covariates, or the relationship between the treatment and
covariates. Further, we provide a Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimator for the
mean under the optimal individualized treatment that allows us to generate valid
inference for our parameter, without having any parametric assumptions.</p>
<p>In the following, we provide a brief overview of the methodology with a focus on
building intuition for the target parameter and its importance — aided with simulations,
data examples and software demonstrations. For more information on the technical aspects
of the algorithm, further practical advice and overview, the interested reader is invited to

</h2>
<p>Suppose we observe <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> independent and identically distributed observations of
the form <span class="math inline">\(O=(W,A,Y) \sim P_0\)</span>. We denote <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> as categorical treatment, and <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>
as the final outcome. In particular, we define <span class="math inline">\(A \in \mathcal{A}\)</span> where
<span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{A} \equiv \{a_1, \cdots, a_{n_A} \}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(n_A = |\mathcal{A}|\)</span>, with
<span class="math inline">\(n_A\)</span> denoting the number of categories (possibly only two, for a binary setup).
Note that we treat <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span> as vector-valued, representing all of our collected
baseline covariates. Therefore, for a single random individual <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>, we have that
their observed data is <span class="math inline">\(O_i\)</span>: with corresponding baseline covariates <span class="math inline">\(W_i\)</span>,
treatment <span class="math inline">\(A_i\)</span>, and final outcome <span class="math inline">\(Y_i\)</span>. Let <span class="math inline">\(O^n = \{O_i\}_{i=1}^n\)</span> denote
<span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> observed samples. Then, we say that <span class="math inline">\(O^n \sim P_0\)</span>, or that all
data was drawn from some true probability distribution <span class="math inline">\(P_0\)</span>. Let <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{M}\)</span>
denote a statistical model for the probability distribution of the data that is
nonparametric, beyond possible knowledge of the treatment mechanism. In words, this
means that we make no assumptions on the relationship between variables, but might
be able to say something about the relationship of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span>, as is the case in
a randomized trial. In general, the more we know, or are willing to assume about the
experiment that produces the data, the smaller the model. The true data generating
distribution <span class="math inline">\(P_0\)</span> is part of the statistical model <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{M}\)</span>, and we write
<span class="math inline">\(P_0 \in \mathcal{M}\)</span>. As in previous chapters, we denote <span class="math inline">\(P_n\)</span> as the empirical distribution
which gives each observation weight <span class="math inline">\(1/n\)</span>.</p>
<p>We use the structural equation model (SEM) in order to define
the process that gives rise to the observed (endogenous) and not observed
(exogenous) variables, as described by <span class="citation">Pearl (<a href="references.html#ref-pearl2009causality" role="doc-biblioref">2009</a>)</span>. In particular, we
denote <span class="math inline">\(U=(U_W,U_A,U_Y)\)</span> as the exogenous random variables, drawn from <span class="math inline">\(U \sim P_U\)</span>.
The endogenous variables, written as <span class="math inline">\(O=(W,A,Y)\)</span>, correspond to the observed data.
We can define the relationships between variables with the following structural equations:
<span class="math display" id="eq:npsem-mopttx">\[\begin{align}
  W &amp;= f_W(U_W) \\ A &amp;= f_A(W, U_A) \\ Y &amp;= f_Y(A, W, U_Y),
  \tag{8.1}
\end{align}\]</span>
where the collection <span class="math inline">\(f=(f_W,f_A,f_Y)\)</span> denotes unspecified functions, beyond possible
knowledge of the treatment mechanism function, <span class="math inline">\(f_A\)</span>. Note that
in the case of a randomized trial, we can write the above NPSEM as
<span class="math display" id="eq:npsem-rt-mopttx">\[\begin{align}
  W &amp;= f_W(U_W) \\ A &amp;= U_A \\ Y &amp;= f_Y(A, W, U_Y),
  \tag{8.2}
\end{align}\]</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(U_A\)</span> has a known distribution and <span class="math inline">\(U_A\)</span> is independent of <span class="math inline">\(U_W\)</span>. We will discuss
this more in later sections on identifiability.</p>
<p>The likelihood of the data admits a factorization, implied by the time ordering
of <span class="math inline">\(O\)</span>. We denote the true density of <span class="math inline">\(O\)</span> as <span class="math inline">\(p_0\)</span>, corresponding to the
distribution <span class="math inline">\(P_0\)</span> and dominating measure <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>.
<span class="math display" id="eq:likelihood-factorization-mopttx">\[\begin{equation}
  p_0(O) = p_{Y,0}(Y \mid A,W) p_{A,0}(A \mid W) p_{W,0}(W) =
    q_{Y,0}(Y \mid A,W) g_{A,0}(A \mid W) q_{W,0}(W),
  \tag{8.3}
\end{equation}\]</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(p_{Y,0}(Y|A,W)\)</span> is the conditional density of <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> given <span class="math inline">\((A, W)\)</span> with
respect to some dominating measure <span class="math inline">\(\mu_Y\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p_{A,0}\)</span> is the conditional density
of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> given <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span> with respect to a counting measure <span class="math inline">\(\mu_A\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(p_{W,0}\)</span> is
the density of <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span> with respect to dominating measure <span class="math inline">\(\mu_W\)</span>. In order to
match relevant Targeted Learning literature, we also
write <span class="math inline">\(P_{Y,0}(Y \mid A, W) = Q_{Y,0}(Y \mid A,W)\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(P_{A,0}(A \mid W) = g_0(A \mid W)\)</span>
and <span class="math inline">\(P_{W,0}(W)=Q_{W,0}(W)\)</span> as the corresponding conditional
distribution of <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> given <span class="math inline">\((A,W)\)</span>, treatment mechanism <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> given <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span>, and
distribution of baseline covariates. For notational simplicity, we additionally define
<span class="math inline">\(\bar{Q}_{Y,0}(A,W) \equiv \E_0[Y \mid A,W]\)</span> as the conditional expectation of
<span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> given <span class="math inline">\((A,W)\)</span>.</p>
<p>Lastly, we define <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> as a subset of the baseline covariates the optimal
individualized rule depends on, where <span class="math inline">\(V \in W\)</span>. Note that <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> could be all of
<span class="math inline">\(W\)</span>, or an empty set, depending on the subject matter knowledge. In particular,
a researcher might want to consider known effect modifiers available at the time
of treatment decision as possible <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> covariates, or consider dynamic treatment
rules based on measurments that can be easily obtained in a clinical setting.
Defining <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> as a more restrictive set of baseline covariates allows us to consider
possibly sub-optimal rules that are easier to estimate, and thereby allows for
statistical inference for the counterfactual mean outcome under the sub-optimal rule;
we will elaborate on this in later sections.</p>

</h2>
<p>Consider dynamic treatment rules, denoted as <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span>, in the set of all possible rules
<span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{D}\)</span>. Then, in a point treatment setting, <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> is a deterministic function
that takes as input <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> and outputs a treatment decision where
<span class="math inline">\(V \rightarrow d(V) \in \{a_1, \cdots, a_{n_A} \}\)</span>. We will use dynamic treatment rules,
and the corresponding treatment decision, to describe an intervention on the
treatment mechanism and the corresponding outcome under a dynamic treatment rule.</p>
<p>As mentioned in the previous section, causal effects are defined in terms of
hypothetical interventions on the SEM <a href="optimal-individualized-treatment-regimes.html#eq:npsem-mopttx">(8.1)</a>. For a given
rule <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span>, our modified system then takes the following form:
<span class="math display" id="eq:npsem-causal-mopttx">\[\begin{align}
  W &amp;= f_W(U_W) \\ A &amp;= d(V) \\ Y_{d(V)} &amp;= f_Y(d(V), W, U_Y),
  \tag{8.4}
\end{align}\]</span>
where the dynamic treatment regime may be viewed as an intervention in which <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>
is set equal to a value based on a hypothetical regime <span class="math inline">\(d(V)\)</span>. The couterfactual outcome
<span class="math inline">\(Y_{d(V)}\)</span> denotes the outcome for a patient had their treatment been assigned using the
dynamic rule <span class="math inline">\(d(V)\)</span>, possibly contrary to the fact. Similarly, the counterfactual
outcomes had all patients been assigned treatment (<span class="math inline">\(A=1\)</span>), or given control (<span class="math inline">\(A=0\)</span>), are
written as <span class="math inline">\(Y_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y_0\)</span>. Finally, we denote the distribution of the counterfactual outcomes
as <span class="math inline">\(P_{U,X}\)</span>, implied by the distribution of exogenous variables <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> and structural
equations <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>. The set of all possible counterfactual distributions are encompased
by the causal model <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{M}^F\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(P_{U,X} \in \mathcal{M}^F\)</span>.</p>
<p>The goal of any causal analysis motivated by such dynamic interventions is to
estimate a parameter defined as the counterfactual mean of the outcome with
respect to the modified intervention distribution. That is, subject’s outcome if,
possibly contrary to the fact, the subject received treatment that would have been
assigned by rule <span class="math inline">\(d(V)\)</span>. Equivalently, we ask the following causal question:
“What is the expected outcome had every subject received treatment according to the
(optimal) individualized treatment?” In order to estimate the optimal individualized
treatment, we set the following optimization problem:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[d_{opt}(V) \equiv \text{argmax}_{d(V) \in \mathcal{D}}
\E_{P_{U,X}}[Y_{d(V)}], \]</span>
where the optimal individualized rule is the rule with the maximal value. We note that, in case
the problem at hand requires minimizing the mean of an outcome, our optimal individualized
rule will be the rule with the minimal value instead.</p>
<p>With that in mind, we can consider different
treatment rules, all in the set <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{D}\)</span>:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>The true rule, <span class="math inline">\(d_{0,\text{opt}}\)</span>, and the corresponding causal parameter
<span class="math inline">\(\E_{U,X}[Y_{d_{0,\text{opt}}(V)}]\)</span> denoting the expected outcome under the
true optimal treatment rule <span class="math inline">\(d_{0,\text{opt}}(V)\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>The estimated rule, <span class="math inline">\(d_{n,\text{opt}}\)</span>, and the corresponding causal parameter

</ol>
<p>In this chapter, we will focus on the value under the estimated optimal rule <span class="math inline">\(d_{n,\text{opt}}\)</span>,
a <strong>data-adaptive parameter</strong>. Note that its true value depends on the sample! Finally,
our causal target parameter of interest is the expected outcome under

</h3>
<p>The optimal individualized rule, as well as the value of an optimal
individualized rule, are causal parameters based on the unobserved
counterfactuals. In order for the causal quantities to be estimated from the
observed data, they need to be identified with statistical parameters. This step
of the roadmap requires we make a few assumptions:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>
<em>Strong ignorability</em>: <span class="math inline">\(A \indep Y^{d_{n, \text{opt}}(v)} \mid W\)</span>, for all <span class="math inline">\(a \in \mathcal{A}\)</span>.</li>
<li>
<em>Positivity (or overlap)</em>: <span class="math inline">\(P_0(\min_{a \in \mathcal{A}} g_0(a \mid W) &gt; 0) = 1\)</span>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Under the above assumptions, we can identify the causal target parameter
with observed data using the G-computation formula. The value of an individualized
rule can now be expressed as</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\E_0[Y_{d_{n, \text{opt}}(V)}] = \E_{0,W}[\bar{Q}_{Y,0}(A=d_{n, \text{opt}}(V),W)],\]</span></p>
<p>which, under assumptions, is interpreted as the mean outcome if
(possibly contrary to fact), treatment was assigned according to the optimal rule.
Finally, the statistical counterpart to the causal parameter of interest is
defined as</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\psi_0 = \E_{0,W}[\bar{Q}_{Y,0}(A=d_{n,\text{opt}}(V),W)].\]</span></p>
<p>Inference for the optimal value has been shown to be difficult at exceptional
laws, defined as probability distributions for which there is a positive
probability on a set of <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span> values for which conditional expectation of <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>
given <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span> is constant in <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> - so all treatments are equally
benefitial. Inference is similarly difficult in finite samples if
the treatment effect is very small in all strata, even though valid asymptotic
estimators exist in this setting. With that in mind, we address the estimation
problem under the assumption of non-exceptional laws in effect.</p>
<p>Many methods for learning the optimal rule from data have been developed
<span class="citation">(Murphy <a href="references.html#ref-murphy2003" role="doc-biblioref">2003</a>; Robins <a href="references.html#ref-robins2004" role="doc-biblioref">2004</a>; Zhang et al. <a href="references.html#ref-laber2012" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a>; Zhao et al. <a href="references.html#ref-kosorok2012" role="doc-biblioref">2012</a>; Chakraborty and Moodie <a href="references.html#ref-moodie2013" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a>)</span>. In this
chapter, we focus on the methods discussed in <span class="citation">Luedtke and van der Laan (<a href="references.html#ref-luedtke2016super" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a>)</span> and
<span class="citation">van der Laan and Luedtke (<a href="references.html#ref-vanderLaanLuedtke15" role="doc-biblioref">2015</a>)</span>. Note however, that <code>tmle3mopttx</code> also supports the widely
used Q-learning approach, where the optimal individualized rule is based on the
initial estimate of <span class="math inline">\(\bar{Q}_{Y,0}(A,W)\)</span> <span class="citation">(Sutton, Barto, and others <a href="references.html#ref-Sutton1998" role="doc-biblioref">1998</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>We follow the methodology outlined in <span class="citation">Luedtke and van der Laan (<a href="references.html#ref-luedtke2016super" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a>)</span> and
<span class="citation">van der Laan and Luedtke (<a href="references.html#ref-vanderLaanLuedtke15" role="doc-biblioref">2015</a>)</span>, where we learn the optimal ITR using Super Learner

Loss-based Estimation (CV-TMLE) <span class="citation">(Zheng and van der Laan <a href="references.html#ref-cvtmle2010" role="doc-biblioref">2010</a>)</span>. In great generality, we first
need to estimate the true individual treatment regime, <span class="math inline">\(d_0(V)\)</span>, which
corresponds to dynamic treatment rule that takes a subset of covariates
<span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> and assigns treatment to each individual based on their observed
covariates <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span>. With the estimate of the true optimal ITR in hand, we can
estimate its corresponding value.</p>
</div>
<div id="binary-treatment" class="section level3">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">8.4.2</span> Binary treatment<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#binary-treatment"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>How do we estimate the optimal individualized treatment regime? In the case of a
binary treatment, a key quantity for optimal ITR is the <strong>blip function</strong>. One can
show that any optimal ITR assigns treatment to individuals falling in strata in
which the stratum specific average treatment effect, the blip, is
positive and does not assign treatment to individuals for which this quantity is
negative. Therefore for a binary treatment, under causal assumptions, we define
the blip function as:
<span class="math display">\[\bar{Q}_0(V) \equiv \E_0[Y_1-Y_0 \mid V] \equiv \E_0[\bar{Q}_{Y,0}(1,W) -
\bar{Q}_{Y,0}(0,W) \mid V],\]</span>
or the average treatment effect within a stratum of <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span>. The note that the
optimal individualized rule can now be derived as <span class="math inline">\(d_{n,\text{opt}}(V) = \mathbb{I}(\bar{Q}_{n}(V) &gt; 0)\)</span>.</p>
<p>The package <code>tmle3mopttx</code> relies on using the Super Learner to estimate the blip
function. With that in mind, the loss function utilized for learning the optimal
individualized rule corresponds to conditional mean type losses. It is however worth
mentioning that <span class="citation">Luedtke and van der Laan (<a href="references.html#ref-luedtke2016super" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a>)</span> present three different approaches for learning the optimal
rule. Namely, they focus on:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Super Learner of the blip function using the squared error loss,</p></li>
<li><p>Super Learner of <span class="math inline">\(d_0\)</span> using the weighted classification loss function,</p></li>
<li><p>Super Learner of <span class="math inline">\(d_0\)</span> that uses a library of candidate estimators that are
implied by estimators of the blip as well as estimators that directly go for
<span class="math inline">\(d_0\)</span> through weighted classification.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>A benefit of relying on the blip function, as implemented in <code>tmle3mopttx</code>, is that
one can look at the distribution of the predicted outcomes of the blip for a given
sample. Having an estimate of the blip allows one to identify patients in the sample
who benefit the most (or the least) from treatment. Additionally, blip-based approach
allows for straight-forward extension to the categorical treatment, interpretable rules,
and OIT under resource constrains, where only a percent of the population can receive
treatment <span class="citation">(A. R. Luedtke and van der Laan <a href="references.html#ref-luedtke2016resource" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Relying on the Targeted Maximum Likelihood (TML) estimator and the Super Learner
estimate of the blip function, we follow the below steps in order to obtain
value of the ITR:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Estimate <span class="math inline">\(\bar{Q}_{Y,0}(A,W)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(g_0(A \mid W)\)</span> using <code>sl3</code>. We denote such
estimates as <span class="math inline">\(\bar{Q}_{Y,n}(A,W)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(g_n(A \mid W)\)</span>.</li>
<li>Apply the doubly robust Augmented-Inverse Probability Weighted (A-IPW)
transform to our outcome (double-robust pseudo-outcome), where we define:
<span class="math display">\[D_{\bar{Q}_Y,g,a}(O) \equiv \frac{\mathbb{I}(A=a)}{g(A \mid W)} (Y -
\bar{Q}_Y(A,W)) + \bar{Q}_Y(A=a,W).\]</span>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that under the randomization and positivity assumptions we have that
<span class="math inline">\(\E[D_{\bar{Q}_Y,g,a}(O) \mid V] = \E[Y_a \mid V]\)</span>. We emphasize the double
robust nature of the A-IPW transform — consistency of <span class="math inline">\(\E[Y_a \mid V]\)</span> will depend
on correct estimation of either <span class="math inline">\(\bar{Q}_{Y,0}(A,W)\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(g_0(A \mid W)\)</span>. As
such, in a randomized trial, we are guaranteed a consistent estimate of <span class="math inline">\(\E[Y_a \mid V]\)</span>
even if we get <span class="math inline">\(\bar{Q}_{Y,0}(A,W)\)</span> wrong! An alternative to the double-robust pseudo-outcome
just presented would be single stage Q-learning, where an estimate <span class="math inline">\(\bar{Q}_{Y,0}(A,W)\)</span>
is used to predict at <span class="math inline">\(\bar{Q}_{Y,n}(A=1,W)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\bar{Q}_{Y,n}(A=0,W)\)</span>. This provides
an estimate of the blip function, <span class="math inline">\(\bar{Q}_{Y,n}(A=1,W) - \bar{Q}_{Y,n}(A=0,W)\)</span>, but
relies on doing a good job on estimating <span class="math inline">\(\bar{Q}_{Y,0}(A,W)\)</span>.</p>
<p>Using the double-robust pseudo-outcome, we can define the following contrast:
<span class="math display">\[D_{\bar{Q}_Y,g}(O) = D_{\bar{Q}_Y, g, a=1}(O) - D_{\bar{Q}_Y, g, a=0}(O).\]</span></p>
<p>We estimate the blip function, <span class="math inline">\(\bar{Q}_{0,a}(V)\)</span>, by regressing
<span class="math inline">\(D_{\bar{Q}_Y,g}(O)\)</span> on <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> using the specified <code>sl3</code> library of learners and an
appropriate loss function. Finally, we are ready for the final steps.</p>
<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: decimal">

<div id="categorical-treatment" class="section level3">

<span class="header-section-number">8.4.3</span> Categorical treatment<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#categorical-treatment"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>In line with the approach considered for binary treatment, we extend the blip
function to allow for categorical treatment. We denote such blip function
extensions as <em>pseudo-blips</em>, which are our new estimation targets in a
categorical setting. We define pseudo-blips as vector-valued entities where the
output for a given <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> is a vector of length equal to the number of treatment
categories, <span class="math inline">\(n_A\)</span>. As such, we define it as:
<span class="math display">\[\bar{Q}_0^{pblip}(V) = \{\bar{Q}_{0,a}^{pblip}(V): a \in \mathcal{A} \}\]</span></p>
<p>We implement three different pseudo-blips in <code>tmle3mopttx</code>.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><em>Blip1</em> corresponds to choosing a reference category of treatment, and
defining the blip for all other categories relative to the specified
reference. Hence we have that:
<span class="math display">\[\bar{Q}_{0,a}^{pblip-ref}(V) \equiv \E_0[Y_a-Y_0 \mid V]\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(Y_0\)</span> is
the specified reference category with <span class="math inline">\(A=0\)</span>. Note that, for the case of
binary treatment, this strategy reduces to the approach described for the
binary setup.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Blip2</em> approach corresponds to defining the blip relative to the average of
all categories. As such, we can define <span class="math inline">\(\bar{Q}_{0,a}^{pblip-avg}(V)\)</span> as:
<span class="math display">\[\bar{Q}_{0,a}^{pblip-avg}(V) \equiv \E_0 [Y_a - \frac{1}{n_A} \sum_{a \in
  \mathcal{A}} Y_a \mid V].\]</span>
In the case where subject-matter knowledge regarding which reference category
to use is not available, blip2 might be a viable option.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Blip3</em> reflects an extension of Blip2, where the average is now a weighted
average:
<span class="math display">\[\bar{Q}_{0,a}^{pblip-wavg}(V) \equiv \E_0 [ Y_a - \frac{1}{n_A} \sum_{a \in
  \mathcal{A}} Y_{a} P(A=a \mid V) \mid V ].\]</span></p></li>

<p>Just like in the binary case, pseudo-blips are estimated by regressing contrasts
composed using the A-IPW transform on <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span>.</p>

</h3>
<p>In a randomized trial, statistical inference relies on the second-order
difference between the estimate of the optimal individualized treatment and the
optimal individualized treatment itself to be asymptotically negligible. This is
a reasonable condition if we consider rules that depend on a small number of
covariates, or if we are willing to make smoothness assumptions. Alternatively,
we can consider TMLEs and statistical inference for data-adaptive target
parameters defined in terms of an estimate of the optimal individualized
treatment. In particular, instead of trying to estimate the mean under the true
optimal individualized treatment, we aim to estimate the mean under the
estimated optimal individualized treatment. As such, we develop cross-validated
TMLE approach that provides asymptotic inference under minimal conditions for
the mean under the estimate of the optimal individualized treatment. In
particular, considering the data adaptive parameter allows us to avoid
consistency and rate condition for the fitted optimal rule, as required for
asymptotic linearity of the TMLE of the mean under the actual, true optimal
rule. Practically, the estimated (data-adaptive) rule should be preferred, as
this possibly sub-optimal rule is the one implemented in the population.</p>

<p>As discussed in <span class="citation">van der Laan and Luedtke (<a href="references.html#ref-vanderLaanLuedtke15" role="doc-biblioref">2015</a>)</span>, CV-TMLE is necessary as the
non-cross-validated TMLE is biased upward for the mean outcome under the rule,
and therefore overly optimistic. More generally however, using CV-TMLE allows us
more freedom in estimation and therefore greater data adaptivity, without
sacrificing inference.</p>

<p>In summary, the mean outcome under the optimal individualized treatment is a
counterfactual quantity of interest representing what the mean outcome would
have been if everybody, contrary to the fact, received treatment that optimized
their outcome. The optimal individualized treatment regime is a rule that
optimizes the mean outcome under the dynamic treatment, where the candidate
rules are restricted to only respond to a user-supplied subset of the baseline
covariates. In essence, our target parameter answers the key
aim of precision medicine: allocating the available treatment by tailoring it to
the individual characteristics of the patient, with the goal of optimizing the
final outcome.</p>

<p>As seen above, we generate three different ensemble learners that must be fit,
corresponding to the learners for the outcome regression (Q), propensity score
(g), and the blip function (B). We make the above explicit with respect to
standard notation by bundling the ensemble learners into a list object below:</p>

<p>The <code>learner_list</code> object above specifies the role that each of the ensemble
learners we’ve generated is to play in computing initial estimators. Recall that
we need initial estimators of relevant parts of the likelihood in order to
build a TMLE for the parameter of interest. In particular, <code>learner_list</code>
makes explicit the fact that our <code>Y</code> is used in fitting the outcome regression,
while <code>A</code> is used in fitting the treatment mechanism regression, and finally <code>B</code>
is used in fitting the blip function.</p>

</h3>
<p>To start, we will initialize a specification for the TMLE of our parameter of
interest simply by calling <code>tmle3_mopttx_blip_revere</code>. We specify the argument
<code>V = c("W1", "W2", "W3")</code> when initializing the <code>tmle3_Spec</code> object in order to
communicate that we’re interested in learning a rule dependent on <code>V</code>
covariates. Note that we don’t have to specify <code>V</code> — this will result in a rule
that is not based on any collected covariates; we will see an example like this
shortly. We also need to specify the type
of (pseudo) blip we will use in this estimation problem, the list of learners used
to estimate the blip function, whether we want to maximize or minimize the final
outcome, and few other more advanced features including searching for a less
complex rule, realistic interventions and possible resource constraints.</p>

<p>As seen above, the <code>tmle3_mopttx_blip_revere</code> specification object
(like all <code>tmle3_Spec</code> objects) does <em>not</em> store the data for our
specific analysis of interest. Later,
we’ll see that passing a data object directly to the <code>tmle3</code> wrapper function,
alongside the instantiated <code>tmle_spec</code>, will serve to construct a <code>tmle3_Task</code>
object internally.</p>
<p>We elaborate more on the initialization specifications. In initializing the
specification for the TMLE of our parameter of interest, we have specified the
set of covariates the rule depends on (<code>V</code>), the type of (pseudo) blip to use
(<code>type</code>), and the learners used for estimating the relevant parts of the
likelihood and the blip function. In addition, we need to specify whether we
want to maximize the mean outcome under the rule (<code>maximize</code>), and whether we
want to estimate the rule under all the covariates <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> provided by the user
(<code>complex</code>). If <code>FALSE</code>, <code>tmle3mopttx</code> will instead consider all the possible
rules under a smaller set of covariates including the static rules, and optimize
the mean outcome over all the subsets of <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span>. As such, while the user might have
provided a full set of collected covariates as input for <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span>, it is possible
that the true rule only depends on a subset of the set provided by the user. In
that case, our returned mean under the optimal individualized rule will be based
on the smaller subset. In addition, we provide an option to search for realistic
optimal individualized interventions via the <code>realistic</code> specification. If
<code>TRUE</code>, only treatments supported by the data will be considered, therefore
alleviating concerns regarding practical positivity issues. Finally, we can incorporate
source constrains by setting <code>resource</code> argument to less than 1. We explore all the
important extensions of <code>tmle3mopttx</code> in later sections.</p>

the blip function. Note that we need to estimate <span class="math inline">\(g_0(A \mid W)\)</span> for a

available within the <code>sl3</code> package with learners that can address multi-class

<p>In this section, we consider two extensions to the procedure described for
estimating the value of the OIT. First one considers a setting where the user
might be interested in a grid of possible sub-optimal rules, corresponding to
potentially limited knowledge of potential effect modifiers. The second
extension concerns implementation of a realistic optimal individual
interventions where certain regimes might be preferred, but due to practical or
global positivity restraints, are not realistic to implement.</p>

<p>In order to not only consider the most ambitious fully <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span>-optimal rule, we
define <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>-optimal rules as the optimal rule that considers all possible subsets
of <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> covariates, with card(<span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>) <span class="math inline">\(\leq\)</span> card(<span class="math inline">\(V\)</span>) and <span class="math inline">\(\emptyset \in S\)</span>. In
particular, this allows us to define a Super Learner for <span class="math inline">\(d_0\)</span> that includes
a range of estimators from very simple (e.g., statis rules) to more complex
(e.g. full <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span>), and let the discrete Super Learner select a simple rule when
appropriate. This allows us to consider sub-optimal rules that are easier to estimate and
potentially provide more realistic rules. Within the <code>tmle3mopttx</code> paradigm, we just need
to change the <code>complex</code> parameter to <code>FALSE</code>:</p>

<p>In addition to considering less complex rules, <code>tmle3mopttx</code> also provides an
option to estimate the mean under the realistic, or implementable, optimal
individualized treatment. It is often the case that assigning particular regime
might have the ability to fully maximize (or minimize) the desired outcome, but
due to global or practical positivity constrains, such treatment can never be
implemented in real life (or is highly unlikely). As such, specifying
<code>realistic</code> to <code>TRUE</code>, we consider possibly suboptimal treatments that optimize

<p>Suppose one wishes to assess the importance of each observed covariate, in
terms of maximizing (or minimizing) the population mean of an outcome under an
optimal individualized treatment regime. In particular, a covariate that
maximizes (or minimizes) the population mean outcome the most under an optimal
individualized treatment out of all other considered covariates under optimal
assignment might be considered <em>more important</em> for the outcome. To put it in
context, perhaps optimal allocation of treatment 1, denoted <span class="math inline">\(A_1\)</span>, results in a
larger mean outcome than optimal allocation of another treatment 2, denoted <span class="math inline">\(A_2\)</span>.
Therefore, we would label <span class="math inline">\(A_1\)</span> as having a higher variable importance with

</h3>
<p>In the previous sections we have seen how to obtain a contrast between the mean
under the optimal individualized rule and the mean under the observed outcome
for a single covariate — we are now ready to run the variable importance analysis
for all of our specified covariates. In order to run the variable importance
analysis, we first need to initialize a specification for the TMLE of our
parameter of interest as we have done before. In addition, we need to specify
the data and the corresponding list of nodes, as well as the appropriate
learners for the outcome regression, propensity score, and the blip function.
Finally, we need to specify whether we should adjust for all the other
covariates we are assessing variable importance for. We will adjust for all <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span>s
in our analysis, and if <code>adjust_for_other_A=TRUE</code>, also for all <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> covariates
that are not treated as exposure in the variable importance loop.</p>
<p>To start, we will initialize a specification for the TMLE of our parameter of
interest (called a <code>tmle3_Spec</code> in the <code>tlverse</code> nomenclature) simply by calling
<code>tmle3_mopttx_vim</code>. First, we indicate the method used for learning the optimal
individualized treatment by specifying the <code>method</code> argument of
<code>tmle3_mopttx_vim</code>. If <code>method="Q"</code>, then we will be using Q-learning for rule
estimation, and we do not need to specify <code>V</code>, <code>type</code> and <code>learners</code> arguments
in the spec, since they are not important for Q-learning. However, if
<code>method="SL"</code>, which corresponds to learning the optimal individualized
treatment using the above outlined methodology, then we need to specify the type
of (pseudo) blip we will use in this estimation problem, whether we want to
maximize or minimize the outcome, complex and realistic rules, resource constraint.
Finally, for <code>method="SL"</code> we also need to communicate that we’re interested in learning a
rule dependent on <code>V</code> covariates by specifying the <code>V</code> argument. For both
<code>method="Q"</code> and <code>method="SL"</code>, we need to indicate whether we want to maximize
or minimize the mean under the optimal individualized rule. Finally, we also
need to specify whether the final comparison of the mean under the optimal
individualized rule and the mean under the observed outcome should be on the
multiplicative scale (risk ratio) or linear (similar to average treatment
effect).</p>

<p>As in the previous sections, we will be using the WASH Benefits data,
corresponding to the effect of water quality, sanitation, hand washing, and
nutritional interventions on child development in rural Bangladesh.</p>
<p>The main aim of the cluster-randomized controlled trial was to assess the
impact of six intervention groups, including:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>control;</p></li>
<li><p>hand-washing with soap;</p></li>
<li><p>improved nutrition through counseling and provision of lipid-based nutrient

<li><p>improved sanitation;</p></li>
<li><p>combined water, sanitation, and hand-washing;</p></li>
<li><p>chlorinated drinking water.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>We aim to estimate the optimal ITR and the corresponding value under the optimal
ITR for the main intervention in WASH Benefits data.</p>
<p>Our outcome of interest is the weight-for-height Z-score, whereas our primary

Why do you think we use these covariates as <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span>? Do we want to minimize or
maximize the outcome? Which (pseudo) blip type should we use?</p></li>
<li><p>Load the WASH Benefits data, and define the appropriate nodes for treatment
and outcome. Use all the rest of the covariates as <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span> except for
<code>momheight</code> for now. Construct an appropriate <code>sl3</code> library for <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Based on the <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> defined in the previous question, estimate the mean under
the ITR for the main randomized intervention used in the WASH Benefits trial
with weight-for-height Z-score as the outcome. What’s the TMLE value of the
optimal ITR? How does it change from the initial estimate? Which
intervention is the most prominent? Why do you think that is?</p></li>
<li><p>Using the same formulation as in questions 1 and 2, estimate the realistic
optimal ITR and the corresponding value of the realistic ITR. Did the results
change? Which intervention is the most prominent under realistic rules? Why do
you think that is?</p></li>
<li><p>Consider simpler rules for the WASH benefits data example. Which covariates does the
final rule depend on?</p></li>
<li><p>Change the treatment to a binary variable (<code>asset_sewmach</code>), and estimate the
value under the ITR in this setting under a <span class="math inline">\(60\%\)</span> resource constraint. What
do the results indicate?</p></li>
<li><p>Change the treatment once again, now to mother’s education (<code>momedu</code>), and
estimate the value under the ITR in this setting. What do the results
indicate? Can we intervene on such a variable?</p></li>

<p>The roadmap of statistical learning is concerned with the translation from
real-world data applications to a mathematical and statistical formulation of
the relevant estimation problem. This involves data as a random variable having
a probability distribution, scientific knowledge represented by a statistical
model, a statistical target parameter representing an answer to the question of
interest, and the notion of an estimator and sampling distribution of the
estimator.</p>

</h3>
<p>The data set we are confronted with is the collection of the results of an
experiment, and we can view the data as a <em>random variable</em> – that is, if we
were to repeat the experiment, we would have a different realization of the data
generated by the experiment in question. In particular, if the experiment were
repeated many times, the probability distribution generating the data, <span class="math inline">\(P_0\)</span>,
could be learned. So, the observed data on a single unit, <span class="math inline">\(O\)</span>, may be thought of
as being drawn from a probability distribution <span class="math inline">\(P_0\)</span>. Most often, we observe <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>
<em>independent identically distributed</em> (i.i.d.) observations of the random
variable <span class="math inline">\(O\)</span>, so the observed data is the collection <span class="math inline">\(O_1, \ldots, O_n\)</span>, where
the subscripts denote the individual observational units. While not all data
are i.i.d., this is certainly the most common case in applied data analysis;
moreover, there are a number of techniques for handling non-i.i.d. data, such as
establishing conditional independence, stratifying data to create distinct sets
of identically distributed data, and inferential corrections for repeated or
clustered observations, to name but a few.</p>
<p>It is crucial that the domain scientist (i.e., researcher) have absolute clarity
about what is actually known about the data-generating distribution for a given
problem of interest. Just as critical is that this scientific information be
communicated to the statistician, whose job it is to use such knowledge to guide
any assumptions encoded in the choice of statistical model. Unfortunately,
communication between statisticians and researchers is often fraught with
misinterpretation. The roadmap provides a mechanism by which to ensure clear
communication between the researcher and the statistician – it is an invaluable
tool for such communication!</p>

<h4>The empirical probability measure, <span class="math inline">\(P_n\)</span><a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#the-empirical-probability-measure-p_n"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h4>
<p>With <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> i.i.d. observations in hand, we can define an empirical probability
measure, <span class="math inline">\(P_n\)</span>. The empirical probability measure is an approximation of the
true probability measure, <span class="math inline">\(P_0\)</span>, allowing us to learn from the observed data.
For example, we can define the empirical probability measure of a set <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> to be
the proportion of observations that belong in <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>. That is,
<span class="math display">\[\begin{equation*}
  P_n(X) = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n} \I(O_i \in X)
\end{equation*}\]</span></p>
<p>In order to start learning from the data, we next need to ask <em>“What do we know
about the probability distribution of the data?”</em> This brings us on to Step 2.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="defining-the-statistical-model-m-such-that-p_0-in-m" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>(2) Defining the statistical model <span class="math inline">\(\M\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(P_0 \in \M\)</span><a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#defining-the-statistical-model-m-such-that-p_0-in-m"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>The statistical model <span class="math inline">\(\M\)</span> is defined by the question we asked at the end of
Step 1. It is the set of possible probability distributions that
could describe our observed data, appropriately constrained by background
scientific knowledge. Often <span class="math inline">\(\M\)</span> is very large (e.g., nonparametric),
reflecting the fact that statistical knowledge about
the data-generating process is limited.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if the probability distribution of the data at hand is described
by a finite number of parameters, then the statistical model is referred to as
<em>parametric</em>. Such an assumption is made, for example, by the proposition that
the random variable of interest, <span class="math inline">\(O\)</span>, has a normal distribution with mean <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>
and variance <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^2\)</span>. More generally, a parametric model may be defined as</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{equation*}
  \M = \{P_{\theta} : \theta \in \R^d \},
\end{equation*}\]</span>
which describes a statistical model consisting of all distributions
<span class="math inline">\(P_{\theta}\)</span>, that is all distributions indexed only by the parameter <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>.</p>
<p>The assumption that the data-generating distribution has a specific, parametric
form is made quite commonly, even when such assumptions are not supported by
existing knowledge. This practice of oversimplification in the current culture
of data analysis typically complicates any attempt at trying to answer the
scientific question at hand, owing to the fact that possible model
misspecification introduces bias of unknown magnitude. The philosophy used to
justify such parametric assumptions is captured by the quote of George Box that
“All models are wrong but some are useful,” which encourages the data analyst to
make arbitrary modeling choices. The result is a practice of data science that
often yields starkly different answers to the same scientific problem, due to
the differing modeling decisions and assumptions made by different analysts.
Even in the nascent days of data analysis, it was recognized that it is “far
better [to develop] an approximate answer to the right question…than an exact
answer to the wrong question, which can always be made precise”
<span class="citation">(Tukey <a href="references.html#ref-tukey1962future" role="doc-biblioref">1962</a>)</span>, though traditional statistics failed to heed this advice for
a number of decades <span class="citation">(Donoho <a href="references.html#ref-donoho2017fifty" role="doc-biblioref">2017</a>)</span>. The Targeted Learning paradigm avoids
this bias by defining the statistical model through a representation of the true
data-generating distribution corresponding to the observed data. The ultimate
goal is to formulate the statistical estimation problem <em>exactly</em>, so that one
can then set out to tailor to the problem the best possible estimation
procedure.</p>
<p>Now, on to Step 3: <em>“What are we trying to learn from the data?”</em></p>
</div>
<div id="the-statistical-target-parameter-psi-and-estimand-psip_0" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>(3) The statistical target parameter <span class="math inline">\(\Psi\)</span> and estimand <span class="math inline">\(\Psi(P_0)\)</span><a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#the-statistical-target-parameter-psi-and-estimand-psip_0"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>The statistical target parameter, <span class="math inline">\(\Psi\)</span>, is defined as a mapping from the
statistical model, <span class="math inline">\(\M\)</span>, to the parameter space (i.e., a real number) <span class="math inline">\(\R\)</span> –
that is, the target parameter is the mapping <span class="math inline">\(\Psi: \M \rightarrow \R\)</span>. The
estimand may be seen as a representation of the quantity that we wish to learn
from the data, the answer to a well-specified (often causal) question of
interest. In contrast to purely statistical estimands, causal estimands require
<em>identification from the observed data</em>, based on causal models that include
several untestable assumptions, described in greater detail in the section on
<a href="roadmap.html#causal">causal target parameters</a>.</p>
<p>For a simple example, consider a data set which contains observations of a
survival time on every subject, for which our question of interest is “What’s
the probability that someone lives longer than five years?” We have,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{equation*}
  \Psi(P_0) = \P_O(O &gt; 5) = \int_5^{\infty} dP_O(o)
\end{equation*}\]</span></p>
<p>This answer to this question is the <strong>estimand, <span class="math inline">\(\Psi(P_0)\)</span></strong>, which is the
quantity we wish to learn from the data. Once we have defined <span class="math inline">\(O\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\M\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(\Psi(P_0)\)</span> we have formally defined the statistical estimation problem.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-estimator-hatpsi-and-estimate-hatpsip_n" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>(4) The estimator <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\Psi}\)</span> and estimate <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\Psi}(P_n)\)</span><a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#the-estimator-hatpsi-and-estimate-hatpsip_n"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>Typically, we will focus on estimation in realistic, nonparametric models. To
obtain a good approximation of the estimand, we need an estimator, an <em>a
priori</em>-specified algorithm defined as a mapping from the set of possible
empirical distributions, <span class="math inline">\(P_n\)</span>, which live in a non-parametric statistical
model, <span class="math inline">\(\M_{NP}\)</span> (<span class="math inline">\(P_n \in \M_{NP}\)</span>), to the parameter space of the parameter of
interest. That is, <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\Psi} : \M_{NP} \rightarrow \R^d\)</span>. The estimator is a
function that takes as input the observed data, a realization of <span class="math inline">\(P_n\)</span>, and
gives as output a value in the parameter space, which is the <strong>estimate,
<span class="math inline">\(\hat{\Psi}(P_n)\)</span></strong>.</p>
<p>Where the estimator may be seen as an operator that maps the observed data and
corresponding empirical distribution to a value in the parameter space, the
numerical output that produced such a function is the estimate. Thus, it is an
element of the parameter space based on the empirical probability distribution
of the observed data. If we plug in a realization of <span class="math inline">\(P_n\)</span> (based on a sample
size <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> of the random variable <span class="math inline">\(O\)</span>), we get back an estimate <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\Psi}(P_n)\)</span>
of the true parameter value <span class="math inline">\(\Psi(P_0)\)</span>.</p>
<p>In order to quantify the uncertainty in our estimate of the target parameter
(i.e., to construct statistical inference), an understanding of the sampling
distribution of our estimator will be necessary. This brings us to Step 5.</p>
</div>
<div id="a-measure-of-uncertainty-for-the-estimate-hatpsip_n" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>(5) A measure of uncertainty for the estimate <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\Psi}(P_n)\)</span><a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#a-measure-of-uncertainty-for-the-estimate-hatpsip_n"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>Since the estimator <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\Psi}\)</span> is a function of the empirical distribution
<span class="math inline">\(P_n\)</span>, the estimator itself is a random variable with a sampling distribution.
So, if we repeat the experiment of drawing <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> observations we would every time
end up with a different realization of our estimate and our estimator has a
sampling distribution.</p>
<p>A primary goal in the construction of estimators is to be able to derive their
asymptotic sampling distributions through a theoretical analysis of a given
estimator. In this regard, an important property of the estimators on which we
focus is their asymptotic linearity, which states that the difference between
the estimator and the target estimand (i.e., the truth) can be represented,
asymptotically, as an average of i.i.d. random variables:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{equation*}
  \hat{\Psi}(P_n) - \Psi(P_0) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n IC(O_i; \nu) +
    o_p(n^{-1/2}),
\end{equation*}\]</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(\nu\)</span> represents possible nuisance parameters on which the influence curve
(IC) depends. Based on the validity of the asymptotic approximation, one can
then invoke the central limit theorem (CLT) to show</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{equation*}
  \sqrt{n} \left(\hat{\Psi}(P_n) - \Psi(P_0)\right) \sim N(0, \sigma^2_{IC}),
\end{equation*}\]</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^2_{IC}\)</span> is the variance of <span class="math inline">\(IC(O_i; \nu)\)</span>. Given an estimate of
<span class="math inline">\(\sigma^2_{IC}\)</span>, it is then possible to construct classic, <em>asymptotically
accurate</em> Wald-type confidence intervals (CIs) and hypothesis tests. For
example, a standard <span class="math inline">\((1 - \alpha)\)</span> CI of the form</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{equation*}
  \Psi(P_n) \pm Z_{1 - \frac{\alpha}{2}} \hat{\sigma_{IC}} / \sqrt{n},
\end{equation*}\]</span>
can be constructed, where <span class="math inline">\(Z_{1 - \frac{\alpha}{2}}\)</span> is the <span class="math inline">\((1 - \frac{\alpha}{2})^\text{th}\)</span> quantile of the standard normal distribution.
Often, we will be interested in constructing 95% confidence intervals,
corresponding to mass <span class="math inline">\(\alpha = 0.05\)</span> in either tail of the limit distribution;
thus, we will typically take <span class="math inline">\(Z_{1 - \frac{\alpha}{2}} \approx 1.96\)</span>.</p>

<p>Data collected across <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> i.i.d. units, <span class="math inline">\(O_1, \ldots, O_n\)</span>, can be viewed as a
collection of random variables, <span class="math inline">\(O\)</span>, all arising from the same probability
distribution <span class="math inline">\(\P_0\)</span>. This collection of data may be expressed <span class="math inline">\(O_1, \ldots, O_n \sim P_0\)</span>, where we leverage statistical knowledge available about the
experiment that generated the data. to support the statement that the true data
distribution <span class="math inline">\(P_0\)</span> falls in a statistical model, <span class="math inline">\(\M\)</span>, which is itself a
collection of candidate probability distributions reflecting the data-generating
experiment. Often these sets – that is, the statistical model <span class="math inline">\(\M\)</span> – must be
very large, to appropriately reflect the fact that statistical knowledge is very
limited. Hence, these <em>realistic</em> statistical models are often termed <em>semi-</em> or
<em>non-parametric</em>, since they are too large to be indexed by a finite-dimensional
set of parameters. Necessarily, our statistical query must begin with, “What
are we trying to learn from the data?”, a question whose answer is captured by
the statistical target parameter, <span class="math inline">\(\Psi\)</span>, which maps the true data-generating
distribution <span class="math inline">\(P_0\)</span> into the statistical estimand, <span class="math inline">\(\Psi(P_0)\)</span>. At this point the
statistical estimation problem is formally defined, allowing for the use of

<p>In many cases, we are interested in problems that ask questions regarding the
<em>causal</em> effect of an intervention on a future outcome of interest. These causal
effects may be defined as summaries of the population of interest (e.g., the
population mean of a particular outcome) under different conditions (e.g.,
treated versus untreated). For example, a causal effect could be defined as the
difference in the means of a disease outcome between <em>causal contrasts</em> in which
the population were to experience low pollution levels (for some pollutant) and
the mean in the same population in the case that high pollution levels were
experienced. There are different ways of operationalizing the theoretical
experiments that generate the counterfactual data necessary for describing our
causal contrasts of interest, including simply assuming that the counterfactual
outcomes exist in theory for all treatment contrasts of interest

<h3>The Causal Model<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#the-causal-model"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>We focus on the use of DAGs and NPSEMs for the description of causal parameters.
Estimators of statistical parameters that correspond, under standard but
untestable <em>identifiability</em> assumptions, to these causal parameters are
introduced below. DAGs are a particularly useful tool for expressing what we
know about the causal relations among variables in the system under study.
Ignoring exogenous <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> terms (explained below), we assume the following ordering
of the variables in the observed data <span class="math inline">\(O\)</span>. We demonstrate the construction of a
DAG below using <code>DAGitty</code> <span class="citation">(Textor, Hardt, and Knüppel <a href="references.html#ref-textor2011dagitty" role="doc-biblioref">2011</a>)</span>:</p>

<p>While DAGs like the above provide a convenient means by which to visualize
causal relations between variables, the same causal relations among variables
can be equivalently represented by an NPSEM:
<span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
  W &amp;= f_W(U_W) \\
  A &amp;= f_A(W, U_A) \\
  Y &amp;= f_Y(W, A, U_Y),
\end{align*}\]</span>
where the <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>’s are unspecified (non-parametric) functions that generate the
corresponding random variable as a function of the variable’s parents (i.e.,
nodes with arrows into the variable) in the DAG and the unobserved, exogenous
error terms (i.e., the <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span>’s). An NPSEM may be thought of as a representation
of the algorithm that produces the data, <span class="math inline">\(O\)</span>, in the population of interest.
Much of statistics and data science is devoted to discovering properties of this
system of equations (e.g., estimation of the prediction function <span class="math inline">\(f_Y\)</span>).</p>
<!--
where $U_W$, $U_A$, and $U_Y$ represent the unmeasured exogenous background
characteristics that influence the value of each variable. In the NPSEM, $f_W$,
$f_A$ and $f_Y$ denote that each variable (for $W$, $A$ and $Y$, respectively)
is a function of its parents and unmeasured background characteristics, but
note that there is no imposition of any particular functional constraints(e.g.,
linear, logit-linear, only one interaction, etc.). For this reason, they are
called non-parametric structural equation models (NPSEMs). The DAG and set of
nonparametric structural equations represent exactly the same information and
so may be used interchangeably.
-->
<p>The first hypothetical experiment we will consider is assigning exposure to the
entire population and observing the outcome, and then withholding exposure to
the same population and observing the outcome. This corresponds to a comparison
of the outcome distribution in the population under two interventions:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>
<span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is set to <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> for all individuals, and</li>
<li>
<span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is set to <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> for all individuals.</li>
</ol>
<p>These interventions imply two new sets of nonparametric structural equations
For the case <span class="math inline">\(A = 1\)</span>, we have
<span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
  W &amp;= f_W(U_W) \\
  A &amp;= 1 \\
  Y(1) &amp;= f_Y(W, 1, U_Y),
\end{align*}\]</span>
while, for the case <span class="math inline">\(A=0\)</span>,
<span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
  W &amp;= f_W(U_W) \\
  A &amp;= 0 \\
  Y(0) &amp;= f_Y(W, 0, U_Y).
\end{align*}\]</span></p>
<p>In these equations, <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is no longer a function of <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span> because of the
intervention on the system that set <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> deterministically to either of the
values <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>. The new symbols <span class="math inline">\(Y(1)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y(0)\)</span> indicate the outcome
variable in the population of interest when it is generated by the respective
NPSEMs above; these are often called <em>counterfactuals</em>. The difference between
the means of the outcome under these two interventions defines a parameter that
is often called the “average treatment effect” (ATE), denoted</p>
<p><span class="math display" id="eq:ate">\[\begin{equation}
  ATE = \E_X(Y(1) - Y(0)),
  \tag{5.1}
\end{equation}\]</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(\E_X\)</span> is the mean under the theoretical (unobserved) full data <span class="math inline">\(X = (W, Y(1), Y(0))\)</span>.</p>
<p>Note, we can define much more complicated interventions on NPSEM’s, such as
interventions based upon rules (themselves based upon covariates), stochastic
rules, etc. and each results in a different targeted parameter and entails
different identifiability assumptions discussed below.</p>

<div id="identifiability" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Identifiability<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#identifiability"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>Because we can never observe both <span class="math inline">\(Y(0)\)</span> (the counterfactual outcome when <span class="math inline">\(A=0\)</span>)
and <span class="math inline">\(Y(1)\)</span> (similarly, the counterfactual outcome when <span class="math inline">\(A=1\)</span>), we cannot
estimate the quantity in Equation <a href="roadmap.html#eq:ate">(5.1)</a> directly. Thus, the primary task
of causal inference methods in our context is to <em>identify</em> the assumptions
necessary to express causal quantities of interest as functions of the
data-generating distribution. We have to make assumptions under which this
quantity may be estimated from the observed data <span class="math inline">\(O \sim P_0\)</span> under the
data-generating distribution <span class="math inline">\(P_0\)</span>. Fortunately, given the causal model
specified in the NPSEM above, we can, with a handful of untestable assumptions,
estimate the ATE from observational data. These assumptions may be summarized as
follows.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p><span id="def:consist-ass" class="definition"><strong>Definition 5.1  (Consistency) </strong></span>The outcome for unit <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(Y_i(a)\)</span> whenever <span class="math inline">\(A_i = a\)</span>, which may be thought of
as “no other versions of treatment” or “no side effects of treatment.”</p>
</div>
<div class="definition">
<p><span id="def:interf-ass" class="definition"><strong>Definition 5.2  (No Interference) </strong></span>The outcome for unit <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(Y_i\)</span>, cannot be affected by the exposure of unit <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>,
<span class="math inline">\(A_j\)</span>, for all <span class="math inline">\(i \neq j\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<div class="definition">
<p><span id="def:noconf-ass" class="definition"><strong>Definition 5.3  (No Unmeasured Confounding) </strong></span><span class="math inline">\(A \perp Y(a) \mid W\)</span> for all <span class="math inline">\(a \in \mathcal{A}\)</span>, which states that the
potential outcomes <span class="math inline">\((Y(a) : a \in \mathcal{A})\)</span> arise independently from
exposure status <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, conditional on the observed covariates <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span>. This is the
analog of the <em>randomization</em> assumption in data arising from natural
experiments, ensuring that the effect of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> on <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> can be disentangled from
that of <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span> on <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>, even though <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span> affects both.</p>
</div>
<div class="definition">
<p><span id="def:posit-ass" class="definition"><strong>Definition 5.4  (Positivity (or Overlap)) </strong></span>All observed units, across strata defined by <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span>, must have a bounded
(non-deterministic) probability of receiving treatment – that is, <span class="math inline">\(0 &lt; \P(A = a \mid W) &lt; 1\)</span> for all <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span>).</p>
</div>
<!--
NH: we should note that consistency is an implied property of the SCM framework
(not so in PO framework) and that no interference is captured in the DAG we
present (but must be explicitly stated in PO).
-->
<p>Given these assumptions, the ATE may be re-written as a function of <span class="math inline">\(P_0\)</span>,
specifically</p>
<p><span class="math display" id="eq:estimand">\[\begin{align}
  \psi_{\text{ATE} &amp;= \E_0(Y(1) - Y(0)) \\ \nonumber
                   &amp;= \E_0 \left(\E_0[Y \mid A = 1, W] -
                      \E_0[Y \mid A = 0, W]\right).
  \tag{5.2}
\end{align}\]</span>
In words, the ATE is the difference in the predicted outcome values for each
subject, under the contrast of treatment conditions (<span class="math inline">\(A = 0\)</span> versus <span class="math inline">\(A = 1\)</span>),
in the population, averaged over all observations. Thus, a parameter of a
theoretical “full” data distribution can be represented as an estimand of the
observed data distribution. Significantly, there is nothing about the
representation in Equation <a href="roadmap.html#eq:estimand">(5.2)</a> that requires parameteric
assumptions; thus, the regressions on the right hand side may be estimated.
With different parameters, there will be potentially different identifiability
assumptions and the resulting estimands can be functions of different components
of <span class="math inline">\(P_0\)</span>. We discuss several more complex estimands in later sections.</p>

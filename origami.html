<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">5.2</span> Introduction<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#introduction-1"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>In this chapter, we start elaborating on the estimation step outlined in the
<a href="intro.html#intro">introductory chapter</a>, which discussed the <a href="intro.html#roadmap"><em>Roadmap for Targeted
Learning</em></a>. In order to generate an initial estimate of our target
parameter – which is the focus of the following <a href="sl3.html#sl3">chapter on Super
Learning</a>, we first need to translate, and incorporate, our knowledge
about the data generating process into the estimation procedure, and decide how
to evaluate our estimation performance.</p>
<p>The performance, or error, of any algorithm used in the estimation procedure
directly relates to its generalizability on the independent data. The proper
assessment of the performance of proposed algorithms is extremely important; it
guides the choice of the final learning method, and it gives us a quantitative
assessment of how good the chosen algorithm is doing. In order to assess the
performance of an algorithm, we introduce the concept of a <strong>loss</strong> function,
which helps us define the <strong>risk</strong>, also referred to as the <strong>expected
prediction error</strong>. Our goal, as further specified in the next chapter, will be
to estimate the true risk of the proposed statistical learning method. Our
goal(s) consist of:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Estimating the performance of different algorithms in order to choose the
best one.</li>
<li>Having chosen a winner, try to estimate the true risk of the proposed
statistical learning method.</li>
</ol>
<p>In the following, we propose a method to do so using the observed data and
<strong>cross-validation</strong> procedure using the <code>origami</code> package <span class="citation">(Coyle and Hejazi <a href="references.html#ref-coyle2018origami">2018</a>)</span>.</p>

<div id="background" class="section level2">
<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">5.3</span> Background<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#background"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>Ideally, in a data-rich scenario, we would split our dataset into three parts:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>training set,</li>
<li>validation set,</li>
<li>test set.</li>
</ol>
<p>The training set is used to fit algorithm(s) of interest; we evaluate the
performance of the fit(s) on a validation set, which can be used to estimate
prediction error (e.g., for tuning and model selection). The final error of the
chosen algorithm(s) is obtained by using the test set, which is kept separately,
and doesn’t see the data before the final evaluation. One might wonder, with
training data readily available, why not use the training error to evaluate the
proposed algorithm’s performance? Unfortunately, the training error is not a
good estimate of the true risk; it consistently decreases with model complexity,
resulting in a possible overfit to the training data and low generalizability.</p>
<p>Since data are often scarce, separating it into training, validation and test
set is usually not possible. In the absence of a large data set and a designated
test set, we must resort to methods that estimate the true risk by efficient
sample re-use. Re-sampling methods, in great generality, involve repeatedly
sampling from the training set and fitting proposed algorithms on the new
samples. While often computationally intensive, re-sampling methods are
particularly useful for model selection and estimation of the true risk. In
addition, they might provide more insight on variability and robustness of the
algorithm fit then fitting an algorithm only once on all the training data.</p>

<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">5.3.1</span> Introducing: cross-validation<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#introducing-cross-validation"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>In this chapter, we focus on <strong>cross-validation</strong> – an essential tool for
evaluating how any given algorithm extends from a sample to the target
population from which the sample is derived. It has seen widespread application
in all facets of statistics, perhaps most notably statistical machine learning.
The cross-validation procedure can be used for model selection, as well as for
estimation of the true risk associated with any statistical learning method in
order to evaluate its performance. It particular, cross-validation directly
estimates the true risk when the estimate is applied to an independent sample
from the joint distribution of the predictors and outcome. When used for model
selection, cross-validation has powerful optimality properties. The asymptotic
optimality results state that the cross-validated selector performs (in terms of
risk) asymptotically as well as an optimal oracle selector based on the true,
unknown data generating distribution. For further details on the theoretical
results, we suggest <span class="citation">van der Laan, Dudoit, and Keles (<a href="references.html#ref-vdl2004asymptotic">2004</a>)</span>, <span class="citation">Dudoit and van der Laan (<a href="references.html#ref-dudoit2005asymptotics">2005</a>)</span> and
<span class="citation">Van der Vaart, Dudoit, and Laan (<a href="references.html#ref-vaart2006oracle">2006</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>In great generality, cross-validation works by partitioning a sample into
complementary subsets, applying a particular algorithm(s) on a subset (the
training set), and evaluating the method of choice on the complementary subset
(the validation/test set). This procedure is repeated across multiple partitions
of the data. A variety of different partitioning schemes exist, depending on the
problem of interest, data size, prevalence of the outcome, and dependence
structure. The <code>origami</code> package provides a suite of tools that generalize the
application of cross-validation to arbitrary data analytic procedures. In the
the following, we describe different types of cross-validation schemes readily
available in <code>origami</code>, introduce the general structure of the <code>origami</code>
package, and show their use in applied settings.</p>

<span class="header-section-number">5.4</span> Estimation Roadmap: how does it all fit together?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#estimation-roadmap-how-does-it-all-fit-together"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>Similarly to how we defined the <a href="intro.html#roadmap"><em>Roadmap for Targeted Learning</em></a>, we
can define the <strong>Estimation Roadmap</strong> to guide the estimation process. In
particular, we have developed a unified loss-based cross-validation methodology
for estimator construction, selection, and performance assessment in a series of
articles (e.g., see <span class="citation">van der Laan, Dudoit, and Keles (<a href="references.html#ref-vdl2004asymptotic">2004</a>)</span>, <span class="citation">Dudoit and van der Laan (<a href="references.html#ref-dudoit2005asymptotics">2005</a>)</span>,
<span class="citation">Van der Vaart, Dudoit, and Laan (<a href="references.html#ref-vaart2006oracle">2006</a>)</span>, and <span class="citation">van der Laan, Polley, and Hubbard (<a href="references.html#ref-vdl2007super">2007</a>)</span>) that follow three main steps:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><strong>The loss funtion</strong>:
Define the target parameter as the minimizer of the expected loss (risk) for a
full data loss function chosen to represent the desired performance measure.
Map the full data loss function into an observed data loss function, having the
same expected value and leading to an efficient estimator of risk.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The algorithms</strong>:
Construct a finite collection of candidate estimators for the parameter of
interest.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The cross-validation scheme</strong>:
Apply appropriate cross-validation to select an optimal estimator among the
candidates, and assess the overall performance of the resulting estimator.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Step 1 of the Estimation Roadmap allows us to unify a broad range of problems
that are traditionally treated separately in the statistical literature,
including density estimation, prediction of polychotomous and continuous
outcomes. For example, if we are interested in estimating the full joint
conditional density, we could use the negative log-likelihood loss. If instead
we are interested in the conditional mean with continuous outcome, one could use
the squared error loss; had the outcome been binary, one could resort to the
indicator (0-1) loss. The unified loss-based framework also reconciles censored
and full data estimation methods, as full data estimators are recovered as
special cases of censored data estimators.</p>

<div id="example-cross-validation-and-prediction" class="section level2">
<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">5.5</span> Example: cross-validation and prediction<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#example-cross-validation-and-prediction"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>Now that we introduced the Estimation Roadmap, we can define our objective with
more mathematical notation, using prediction as an example. Let the observed
data be defined as <span class="math inline">\(X = (W,Y)\)</span>, where a unit specific data can be written as
<span class="math inline">\(X_i = (W_i,Y_i)\)</span>, for <span class="math inline">\(i = 1, \ldots, n\)</span>. For each of the <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> samples, we
denote <span class="math inline">\(Y_i\)</span> as the outcome of interest (polychotomous or continuous), and <span class="math inline">\(W_i\)</span>
as a <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-dimensional set of covariates. Let <span class="math inline">\(\psi_0(W)\)</span> denote the target
parameter of interest we want to estimate; for this example, we are interested
in estimating the conditional expectation of the outcome given the covariates,
<span class="math inline">\(\psi_0(W) = E(Y \mid W)\)</span>. Following the Estimation Roadmap, we chose the
appropriate loss function, <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span>, such that <span class="math inline">\(\psi_0(W) = \text{argmin}_{\psi} E[L(X,\psi(W))]\)</span>. But how do we know how each <span class="math inline">\(\psi\)</span> is doing? In order to pick
the optimal estimator among the candidates, and assess the overall performance
of the resulting estimator, use cross-validation – dividing the available data
into the training set and validation set. Observations in the training set are
used to fit (or train) the estimator, while the validation set is used to assess
the risk of (or validate) it.</p>
<p>To derive a general representation for cross-validation, we define a <strong>split
vector</strong>, <span class="math inline">\(B_n = (B_n(i): i = 1, \ldots, n) \in \{0,1\}^n\)</span>. Note that split
vector is independent of the empirical distribution, <span class="math inline">\(P_n\)</span>. A realization of
<span class="math inline">\(B_n\)</span> defines a random split of the data into a training and validation set such
that if
<span class="math display">\[B_n(i) = 0, \ \ \text{i sample is in the training set}\]</span>
<span class="math display">\[B_n(i) = 1, \ \ \text{i sample is in the validation set.}\]</span>
We can further define <span class="math inline">\(P_{n,B_n}^0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(P_{n,B_n}^1\)</span> as the empirical
distributions of the training and validation sets, respectively. Then <span class="math inline">\(n_0 = \sum_i 1-B_n(i)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(n_1 = \sum_i B_n(i)\)</span> denote the number of samples in each
set. The particular distribution of the split vector <span class="math inline">\(B_n\)</span> defines the type of
cross-validation scheme, tailored to the problem and data set in hand.</p>

<p>As we specified earlier, the particular distribution of the split vector <span class="math inline">\(B_n\)</span>
defines the type of cross-validation method. In the following, we describe
different types of cross-validation schemes available in <code>origami</code> package, and

<p>In order to illustrate different cross-validation schemes, we will be using the
WASH data. Detailed information on the WASH Benefits Example Dataset can be

weight-for-height z-score <code>whz</code> using the available covariate data. For this

<p>The re-substitution method is the simplest strategy for estimating the risk
associated with fitting a proposed algorithm on a set of observations. Here, all
observed data is used for both training and validation set.</p>
<p>We illustrate the usage of the re-substitution method with <code>origami</code> package
below; we will use the function <code><a href="http://tlverse.org/origami/reference/fold_funs.html">folds_resubstitution(n)</a></code>. In order to setup
<code><a href="http://tlverse.org/origami/reference/fold_funs.html">folds_resubstitution(n)</a></code>, we just need the total number of samples we want to
allocate to training and validation sets; remember that each row of data is a
unique i.i.d. sample. Notice the structure of the <code>origami</code> output:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>v: the cross-validation fold</li>
<li>training_set: the indexes of the samples in the training set</li>
<li>validation_set: the indexes of the samples in the training set.</li>
</ol>
<p>This structure of the <code>origami</code> output (fold(s)) will persist for each of the
cross-validation schemes we present in this chapter. Below, we show the fold
generated by the re-substitution method:</p>

<h4>
<span class="header-section-number">5.6.1.2</span> Holdout method<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#holdout-method"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h4>
<p>The holdout method, or the validation set approach, consists of randomly
dividing the available data into the training set and validation set (holdout
set). The model is then fitted on the training set, and further evaluated on
the observations in the validation set. Typically, the data is split into
<span class="math inline">\(60/40\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(70/30\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(80/20\)</span> splits.</p>
<p>The holdout method is intuitive, conceptually easy, and computationally not too
demanding. However, if we repeat the process of randomly splitting the data into
the training and validation set, we might get a different validation loss (e.g.,
MSE). In particular, the loss over the validation sets might be highly
variable, depending on which samples were included in the training/validation
split. For classification problems, there is a possibility of an uneven
distribution of different classes in the training and validation set unless data
is stratified. Finally, note that we are not using all of the data to train and
evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm, which might result in bias.</p>
</div>
<div id="leave-one-out" class="section level4">
<h4>
<span class="header-section-number">5.6.1.3</span> Leave-one-out<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#leave-one-out"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h4>
<p>The leave-one-out cross-validation scheme is closely related to the holdout
method. In particular, it also involves splitting the data into the training and
validation set; however, instead of partitioning the observed data into sets of
similar size, a single observation is used as a validation set. With that,
majority of the units are employed for training (fitting) the proposed
algorithm. Since only one unit (for example <span class="math inline">\(x_1 = (w_1, y_1)\)</span>) is not used in
the fitting process, leave-one-out cross-validation results in a possibly less
biased estimate of the true risk; typically, leave-one-out approach will not
overestimate the risk as much as the holdout method. On the other hand, since
the estimate of risk is based on a single sample, it is typically a highly
variable estimate.</p>
<p>We can repeat the process of spiting the data into training and validation set
until all samples are part of the validation set at some point. For example,
next iteration of the cross-validation might have <span class="math inline">\(x_2 = (w_2,y_2)\)</span> as the
validation set and all the rest of <span class="math inline">\(n-1\)</span> samples as the training set. Repeating
this approach <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> times results in, for example, <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> squared errors <span class="math inline">\(MSE_1, MSE_2, \ldots, MSE_n\)</span>. The estimate of the true risk is the average over the
<span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> squared errors. While the leave-one-out cross-validation results in a less
biased (albeit, more variable) estimate of risk than the holdout method, it
could be expensive to implement if <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is large.</p>
<p>We illustrate the usage of the leave-one-out cross-validation with <code>origami</code>
package below; we will use the function <code><a href="http://tlverse.org/origami/reference/fold_funs.html">folds_loo(n)</a></code>. In order to setup
<code><a href="http://tlverse.org/origami/reference/fold_funs.html">folds_loo(n)</a></code>, similarly to the re-substitution method, we just need the total
number of samples we want to cross-validate. We show the first two folds
generated by the leave-one-out cross-validation below.</p>

<h4>
<span class="header-section-number">5.6.1.4</span> V-fold<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#v-fold"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h4>
<p>An alternative to leave-one-out is V-fold cross-validation. This
cross-validation scheme randomly divides the data into <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> sets (folds) of equal
size; for each fold, the number of samples in the validation set are the same.
For V-fold cross-validation, one of the folds is treated as a validation set,
whereas the proposed algorithm is fit on the remaining <span class="math inline">\(v-1\)</span> folds in the
training set. The loss, for example MSE, is computed on the samples in the
validation set. With the proposed algorithm trained and its performance
evaluated on the first fold, we repeat this process <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> times; each time, a
different group of samples is treated as a validation set. Note that with V-fold
cross-validation we effectively use all of the data to train and evaluate the
proposed algorithm without overfitting to the training data. In the end, the
V-fold cross-validation results in <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> estimates of validation error. The final
V-fold CV estimate is computed as an average over all the validation losses.</p>
<p>For a dataset with <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> samples, V-fold cross-validation with <span class="math inline">\(v=n\)</span> is just
leave-one-out; similarly, if we set <span class="math inline">\(n=1\)</span>, we can get the holdout method’s
estimate of algorithm’s performance. Despite the obvious computational
advantages, V-fold cross-validation often gives more accurate estimates of the
true risk. The reason for this comes from the bias-variance trade-off that comes
from employing both methods; while leave-one-out might be less biased, it has
higher variance. This difference becomes more obvious as <span class="math inline">\(v&lt;&lt;n\)</span> (but not too
small, as then we increase bias). With V-fold cross-validation, we end up
averaging output from <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> fits that are typically less correlated than the
outputs from leave-one-out fits. Since the mean of many highly correlated
quantities has higher variance, leave-one-out estimate of the risk will also
have higher variance than the estimate based on V-fold cross-validation.</p>
<p>Let’s see V-fold cross-validation with <code>origami</code> in action! In the next chapter
we will study the Super Learner, an actual algorithm that we fit and evaluate
its performance, that uses V-fold as default cross-validation scheme. In order
to set up V-fold CV, we need to call function <code><a href="http://tlverse.org/origami/reference/fold_funs.html">folds_vfold(n, V)</a></code>. Arguments
for <code><a href="http://tlverse.org/origami/reference/fold_funs.html">folds_vfold(n, V)</a></code> require the total number of samples to be
cross-validated, and the number of folds we want to get.</p>
<p>At <span class="math inline">\(V=2\)</span>, we get 2 folds with <span class="math inline">\(n/2\)</span> number of samples in both training and
validation set.</p>

<p>With Monte Carlo cross-validation, we randomly select some fraction of the data
(without replacement) to form the training set; we assign the rest of the
samples to the validation set. With that, the data is repeatedly and randomly
divided into two sets, a training set of <span class="math inline">\(n_0 = n \cdot (1-p)\)</span> observations and
a validation set of <span class="math inline">\(n_1 = n \cdot p\)</span> observations. This process is then
repeated multiple times, generating (at random) new training and validation
partitions each time.</p>
<p>Since the partitions are independent across folds, the same sample can appear in
the validation set multiple times – note that this is a stark difference
between Monte Carlo and V-fold cross-validation. With Monte Carlo
cross-validation, one is able to explore many more available partitions than
with V-fold cross-validation – resulting in a possibly less variable estimate
of the risk, at a cost of an increase in bias.</p>
<p>We illustrate the usage of the Monte Carlo cross-validation with <code>origami</code>
package below using the function <code><a href="http://tlverse.org/origami/reference/fold_funs.html">folds_montecarlo(n, V, pvalidation)</a></code>. In order
to setup <code><a href="http://tlverse.org/origami/reference/fold_funs.html">folds_montecarlo(n, V, pvalidation)</a></code>, we need:</p>

<li>the total number of samples we want to cross-validate;</li>
<li>the number of folds;</li>
<li>the proportion of observations to be placed in the validation set.</li>
</ol>
<p>At <span class="math inline">\(V=2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(pvalidation=0.2\)</span>, we obtain 2 folds with approximately <span class="math inline">\(6\)</span> samples
in validation set per fold.</p>

<p>Rolling origin cross-validation scheme lends itself to “online” algorithms,
where large streams of data have to be fit continually, and the final fit is
constantly updated with more data acquired. In general, the rolling origin
scheme defines an initial training set, and with each iteration the size of the
training set grows by <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> observations until we reach time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> for a particular
fold. The time points included in the training set are always behind the
validation set time points; in addition, there might be a gap between training
and validation times of size <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span>.</p>
<p>To further illustrate rolling origin cross-validation, we show below an example
with 3 folds. Here, the first window size is 15 time points, on which we first
train the proposed algorithm. We then evaluate its performance on 10 time
points, with a gap of size 5 between the training and validation time points.
For the following fold, we train the algorithm on a longer stream of data, 25
time points, including the original 15 we started with. We then evaluate its
performance on 10 time points in the future.</p>

<p>Instead of adding more time points to the training set per each iteration, the
rolling window cross-validation scheme “rolls” the training sample forward by
<span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> time units. The rolling window scheme might be considered in parametric
settings when one wishes to guard against moment or parameter drift that is
difficult to model explicitly; it is also more efficient for computationally
demanding settings such as streaming data, in which large amounts of training
data cannot be stored. In contrast to rolling origin CV, the training sample for
each iteration of the rolling window scheme is always the same.</p>
<p>To illustrate the rolling window cross-validation with 3 time-series folds
below. The first window size is 15 time points, on which we first train the
proposed algorithm. As in the previous illustration, we evaluate its performance
on 10 time points, with a gap of size 5 between the training and validation time
points. However, for the next fold, we train the algorithm on time points
further away from the origin (here, 10 time points). Note that the size of the
training set in the new fold is the same as in the first fold (15 time points).
This setup keeps the training sets comparable over time (and fold) as compared
to the rolling origin CV. We then evaluate the performance of the proposed
algorithm on 10 time points in the future.</p>

rolling-window-<span class="math inline">\(V\)</span>-fold cross-validation with <code>origami</code> package using the
function <code><a href="http://tlverse.org/origami/reference/fold_funs.html">folds_vfold_rolling_window_pooled(n, t, id, time, V, window_size, validation_size, gap, batch)</a></code>. In the figure below, we show <span class="math inline">\(V=2\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span>-folds, and
2 time-series CV folds.</p>

<span class="header-section-number">5.7</span> General workflow of <code>origami</code><a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#general-workflow-of-origami"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>Before we dive into more details, let’s take a moment to review some of the
basic functionality in <code>origami</code> R package. The main function in the <code>origami</code>
is <code>cross_validate</code>. To start off, the user must define folds and a function
that operates on each fold. Once these are passed to <code>cross_validate</code>, this
function will map the fold-specific function across the folds, combining the
results in a reasonable way. We will see this in action in later sections; for
now, we provide specific details on each each step of this process below.</p>
<div id="define-folds" class="section level3">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">5.7.1</span> (1) Define folds<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#define-folds"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>The <code>folds</code> object passed to <code>cross_validate</code> is a list of folds; such lists can
be generated using the <code>make_folds</code> function. Each fold consists of a list with
a <code>training</code> index vector, a <code>validation</code> index vector, and a <code>fold_index</code> (its
order in the list of folds). This function supports a variety of
cross-validation schemes we describe in the following section. The <code>make_folds</code>
can balance across levels of a variable (<code>strata_ids</code>), and it can also keep
all observations from the same independent unit together (<code>cluster</code>).</p>
</div>
<div id="define-fold-function" class="section level3">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">5.7.2</span> (2) Define fold function<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#define-fold-function"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>The <code>cv_fun</code> argument to <code>cross_validate</code> is a function that will perform some
operation on each fold. The first argument to this function must be <code>fold</code>,
which will receive an individual fold object to operate on. Additional arguments
can be passed to <code>cv_fun</code> using the <code>...</code> argument to <code>cross_validate</code>. Within
this function, the convenience functions <code>training</code>, <code>validation</code> and
<code>fold_index</code> can return the various components of a fold object. If <code>training</code>
or <code>validation</code> is passed an object, it will index into it in a sensible way.
For instance, if it is a vector, it will index the vector directly. If it is a
<code>data.frame</code> or <code>matrix</code>, it will index rows. This allows the user to easily
partition data into training and validation sets. The fold function must return
a named list of results containing whatever fold-specific outputs are generated.</p>
</div>
<div id="apply-cross_validate" class="section level3">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">5.7.3</span> (3) Apply <code>cross_validate</code><a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#apply-cross_validate"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>After defining folds, <code>cross_validate</code> can be used to map the <code>cv_fun</code> across
the <code>folds</code> using <code>future_lapply</code>. This means that it can be easily parallelized
by specifying a parallelization scheme (i.e., a <code>plan</code> from the <a href="https://Cran.R-project.org/package=future">future
parallelization framework for <code>R</code></a>
<span class="citation">(Bengtsson <a href="references.html#ref-bengtsson2020unifying">2020</a>)</span>). The application of <code>cross_validate</code> generates a list
of results. As described above, each call to <code>cv_fun</code> itself returns a list of
results, with different elements for each type of result we care about. The main
loop generates a list of these individual lists of results (a sort of
“meta-list”). This “meta-list” is then inverted such that there is one element
per result type (this too is a list of the results for each fold). By default,
<code>combine_results</code> is used to combine these results type lists in a sensible
manner. How results are combined is determined automatically by examining the
data types of the results from the first fold. This can be modified by
specifying a list of arguments to <code>.combine_control</code>.</p>

<p>Let’s see <code>origami</code> in action! In the following chapter we will learn how to use
cross-validation with the Super Learner, and how we can utilize the power of
cross-validation to build optimal ensembles of algorithms, not just its use on a
single statistical learning method.</p>

</h3>
<p>First, we will load the relevant <code>R</code> packages, set a seed, and load the full
WASH data once again. In order to illustrate cross-validation with <code>origami</code> and
linear regression, we will focus on predicting the weight-for-height Z-score
<code>whz</code> using all of the available covariate data. As stated previously, we will
assume the data is independent and identically distributed, ignoring the cluster
structure imposed by the clinical trial design. For the sake of illustration, we
will work with a subset of data, and remove all samples with missing data from
the dataset; we will learn in the next chapter how to deal with missingness.</p>

<p>We can assess how well the model fits the data by comparing the predictions of
the linear model to the true outcomes observed in the data set. This is the well
known (and standard) mean squared error. We can extract that from the <code>lm</code> model
object like so:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb23"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span class="op">(</span><span class="va">err</span> <span class="op">&lt;-</span> <span class="fu"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/mean.html">mean</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="fu"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/stats/residuals.html">resid</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="va">lm_mod</span><span class="op">)</span><span class="op">^</span><span class="fl">2</span><span class="op">)</span><span class="op">)</span>

<p>The mean squared error is 0.86568. There is an important problem that arises
when we assess the model in this way - that is, we have trained our linear
regression model on the full data set and assessed the error on the full data
set, using up all of our data. We, of course, are generally not interested in
how well the model explains variation in the observed data; rather, we are
interested in how the explanation provided by the model generalizes to a target
population from which the sample is presumably derived. Having used all of our
available data, we cannot honestly evaluate how well the model fits (and thus
explains) variation at the population level.</p>
<p>To resolve this issue, cross-validation allows for a particular procedure (e.g.,
linear regression) to be implemented over subsets of the data, evaluating how
well the procedure fits on a testing (“validation”) set, thereby providing an
honest evaluation of the error.</p>
<p>We can easily add cross-validation to our linear regression procedure using
<code>origami</code>. First, let us define a new function to perform linear regression on a
specific partition of the data (called a “fold”):</p>

<p>Our <code>cv_lm</code> function is rather simple: we merely split the available data into a
training and validation sets, using the eponymous functions provided in
<code>origami</code>, fit the linear model on the training set, and evaluate the model on
the testing set. This is a simple example of what <code>origami</code> considers to be
<code>cv_fun</code> – functions for using cross-validation to perform a particular routine
over an input data set. Having defined such a function, we can simply generate a
set of partitions using <code>origami</code>’s <code>make_folds</code> function, and apply our <code>cv_lm</code>
function over the resultant <code>folds</code> object. Below, we replicate the
re-substitution estimate of the error – we did this “by hand” above – using
the functions <code>make_folds</code> and <code>cv_lm</code>.</p>

<p>This (nearly) matches the estimate of the error that we obtained above.</p>
<p>We can more honestly evaluate the error by V-fold cross-validation, which
partitions the data into <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> subsets, fitting the model on <span class="math inline">\(v - 1\)</span> of the
subsets and evaluating on the subset that was held out for testing. This is
repeated such that each subset is used for testing. We can easily apply our
<code>cv_lm</code> function using <code>origami</code>’s <code>cross_validate</code> (n.b., by default this
performs 10-fold cross-validation):</p>

<p>Using 10-fold cross-validation (the default), we obtain an honest estimate of
the prediction error of random forests. From this, we gather that the use of
<code>origami</code>’s <code>cross_validate</code> procedure can be generalized to arbitrary estimation
techniques, given availability of an appropriate <code>cv_fun</code> function.</p>

<p>Cross-validation can also be used for forecast model selection in a time series
setting. Here, the partitioning scheme mirrors the application of the
forecasting model: we’ll train the data on past observations (either all
available or a recent subset), and then use the model fit to predict the next
few observations. We consider the <code>AirPassengers</code> dataset again, a monthly time
series of passenger air traffic in thousands of people.</p>

10 points each iteration. Since we want to forecast the immediate next point,
